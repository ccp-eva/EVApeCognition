abstract: 'Although an extensive body of literature exists on the cognitive underpinnings
  of gaze movements in macaques and humans, few studies have investigated this topic
  from a broader evolutionary perspective. This study used the gap–overlap paradigm
  to examine the timing of the gaze movements by four hominid species: humans, chimpanzees,
  gorillas, and orangutans. The saccade latency involved in shifting the gaze from
  central to peripheral stimuli was measured and compared under two conditions, gap
  and overlap. The central stimulus disappeared shortly before the onset of the peripheral
  stimulus under the gap condition, but it remained under the overlap condition. Although
  all species demonstrated similar saccade latencies under the gap condition, the
  species clearly differed from one another under the overlap condition, which may
  suggest their similar perceptual and motor mechanism of making a saccade on the
  one hand and their differential strategies for coping with the competition between
  two activities involving fixation and initiation of a saccade (i.e. central vs.
  peripheral visual stimuli) on the other hand. In particular, humans showed longer
  saccade latency under the overlap condition compared to the other great apes, which
  may reflect this species’ unique means of visual processing.'
