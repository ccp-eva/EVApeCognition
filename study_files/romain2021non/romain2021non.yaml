abstract: Decision outcomes in unpredictable environments may not have exact known
  probabilities. Yet the predictability level of outcomes matters in decisions, and
  animals, including humans, generally avoid ambiguous options. Managing ambiguity
  may be more challenging and requires stronger cognitive skills than decision-making
  under risk, where decisions involve known probabilities. Here we compare decision-making
  in capuchins, macaques, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos in risky and
  ambiguous contexts. Subjects were shown lotteries (a tray of potential rewards,
  some large, some small) and could gamble a medium-sized food item to obtain one
  of the displayed rewards. The odds of winning and losing varied and were accessible
  in the risky context (all rewards were visible) or partially available in the ambiguous
  context (some rewards were covered). In the latter case, the level of information
  varied from fully ambiguous (individuals could not guess what was under the covers)
  to predictable (individuals could guess). None of the species avoided gambling in
  ambiguous lotteries and gambling rates were high if at least two large rewards were
  visible. Capuchins and bonobos ignored the covered items and gorillas and macaques
  took the presence of potential rewards into account, but only chimpanzees and orangutans
  could consistently build correct expectations about the size of the covered rewards.
  Chimpanzees and orangutans combined decision rules according to the number of large
  visible rewards and the level of predictability, a process resembling conditional
  probabilities assessment in humans. Despite a low sample size, this is the first
  evidence in non-human primates that a combination of several rules can underlie
  choices made in an unpredictable environment. Our finding that non-human primates
  can deal with the uncertainty of an outcome when exchanging one food item for another
  is a key element to the understanding of the evolutionary origins of economic behaviour.
