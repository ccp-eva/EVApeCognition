abstract: 'Humans routinely incur costs when allocating resources and reject distributions
  judged to be below/over an expected threshold. The dictator/ultimatum games (DG/UG)
  are two-player games that quantify prosociality and inequity aversion by measuring
  allocated distributions and rejection thresholds. Although the UG has been administered
  to chimpanzees and bonobos, no study has used both games to pinpoint their motivational
  substrate. We administered a DG/UG using preassigned distributions to four chimpanzee
  dyads controlling for factors that could explain why proposers’ behavior varied
  substantially across previous studies: game order, cost for proposers, and amount
  for recipients. Moreover, players exchanged their roles (proposer/recipient) to
  test reciprocity. Our results show that proposers offered more in the DG than in
  the nonsocial baseline, particularly when they incurred no cost. In UG, recipients
  accepted all above-zero offers, suggesting absence of inequity aversion. Proposers
  preferentially chose options that gave larger amounts to the partner. However, they
  also decreased their offers across sessions, probably being inclined to punish their
  partner’s rejections. Therefore, chimpanzees were not strategically motivated toward
  offering more generously to achieve ulterior acceptance from their partner. We found
  no evidence of reciprocity. We conclude that chimpanzees are generous rational maximizers
  that may not engage in strategic behavior.'
