abstract: While preferences for perceptual features of objects are well studied in
  humans, little is known about this trait in other great apes. We therefore presented
  captive Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo abelii) with objects that differed in shape
  (spherical, cuboid), colour (red, green), or texture (hard, soft). Overall, orang-utans
  preferred spherical over cuboid and red over green objects. Soft objects were preferred
  over hard ones. However, this preference might be confounded by the decomposable
  characteristic of soft objects since the orang-utans often unwrapped them. This
  study shows object preferences in orang-utans similar to those in humans, suggesting
  that perceptual preferences for basic object features such as shape and colour may
  be shared across primate species
