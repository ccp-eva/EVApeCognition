abstract: 'Determining the memory systems that support nonhuman animals’ capacity
  to remember distant past events is currently the focus an intense research effort
  and a lively debate [1, 2, 3]. Comparative psychology has largely adopted Tulving’s
  framework by focusing on whether animals remember what-where-when something happened
  (i.e., episodic-like memory) [4, 5, 6]. However, apes have also been reported to
  recall other episodic components [7] after single-trial exposures [8, 9]. Using
  a new experimental paradigm we show that chimpanzees and orangutans recalled a tool-finding
  event that happened four times 3 years earlier (experiment 1) and a tool-finding
  unique event that happened once 2 weeks earlier (experiment 2). Subjects were able
  to distinguish these events from other tool-finding events, which indicates binding
  of relevant temporal-spatial components. Like in human involuntary autobiographical
  memory, a cued, associative retrieval process triggered apes’ memories: when presented
  with a particular setup, subjects instantaneously remembered not only where to search
  for the tools (experiment 1), but also the location of the tool seen only once (experiment
  2). The complex nature of the events retrieved, the unexpected and fast retrieval,
  the long retention intervals involved, and the detection of binding strongly suggest
  that chimpanzees and orangutans’ memories for past events mirror some of the features
  of human autobiographical memory.'
