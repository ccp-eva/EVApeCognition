abstract: In contrast to apes' seemingly sophisticated skill at producing pointing
  gestures referentially, the comprehension of other individual's pointing gestures
  as a source of indexical information seems to be less pronounced.One reason for
  apes' difficulty at comprehending pointing gestures might be that in former studies
  they were mainly confronted with human declarative pointing gestures, whereas apes
  have largely been shown to point imperatively and towards humans. In the present
  study bonobos, chimpanzees and orangutans were confronted with a conspecific's imperative
  pointing gesture in a competitive context, therefore mirroring former studies that
  have investigated apes' skills at producing these gestures.However, apes in the
  present study did not use their conspecific's pointing gestures. Apes have been
  shown to use indexical information when provided noncommunicatively and to interpret
  other individuals' actions in terms of motives. Thus, it is discussed whether apes
  treat a pointing gesture as intentional act of indexical reference.
