abstract: Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, help others in a variety of contexts. Some
  researchers have claimed that this only occurs when food is not involved and the
  recipient actively solicits help. In the current study, however, we found that chimpanzees
  often helped conspecifics obtain food in a pulling task with no solicitation whatsoever,
  in a situation in which, based on past experience, the conspecific’s desire for
  the food was apparent.We also assessed whether the collaborative context of the
  situation impacted helping rates. Specifically, we compared how often both partners
  obtained rewards when one partner needed the help of the other, who had already
  received a reward for free (helping without collaboration), and when one partner
  needed the other’s help after they had already begun collaborating (helping during
  collaboration). Partners provided assistance significantly more often in both of
  these helping conditions than in a control condition in which partners could provide
  unneeded help. However, unlike human children who have been tested in a similar
  task, chimpanzees did not help their partner more during (than without) collaboration.
  These results suggest that chimpanzees’ helping behaviour is more robust than previously
  believed, but at the same time may have different evolutionary roots from the helping
  behaviour of humans.
