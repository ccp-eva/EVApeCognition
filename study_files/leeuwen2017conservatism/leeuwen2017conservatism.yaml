abstract: Social learning is predicted to evolve in socially living animals provided
  the learning process is not random but biased by certain socio-ecological factors.
  One bias of particular interest for the emergence of (cumulative) culture is the
  tendency to forgo personal behaviour in favour of relatively better variants observed
  in others, also known as the ‘‘copy-if-better’’ strategy. We investigated whether
  chimpanzees employ copy-if-better in a simple token-exchange paradigm controlling
  for individual and random social learning. After being trained on one token-type,
  subjects were confronted with a conspecific demonstrator who either received the
  same food reward as the subject (control condition) or a higher value food reward
  than the subject (test condition) for exchanging another token-type. In general,
  the chimpanzees persisted in exchanging the token-type they were trained on individually,
  indicating a form of conservatism consistent with previous studies. However, the
  chimpanzees were more inclined to copy the demonstrator in the test compared to
  the control condition, indicating a tendency to employ a copy-if-better strategy.
  We discuss the validity of our results by considering alternative explanations and
  relate our findings to the emergence of cumulative culture.
