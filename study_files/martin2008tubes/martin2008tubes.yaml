abstract: Previous studies on tool using have shown that presenting subjects with
  certain modifications in the experimental setup can substantially improve their
  performance. However, procedural modifications (e.g. trap table task) may not only
  remove task constraints but also simplify the problem conceptually. The goal of
  this study was to design a variation of the trap-table that was functionally equivalent
  to the trap-tube task. In this new task, the subjects had to decide where to insert
  the tool and in which direction the reward should be pushed. We also administered
  a trap-tube task that allowed animals to push or rake the reward with the tool to
  compare the subjectsâ€™ performance on both tasks. We used a larger sample of subjects
  than in previous studies and from all the four species of great apes (Gorilla gorilla,
  Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus). The results showed that apes
  performed better in the trap-platform task than in the trap-tube task. Subjects
  solved the tube task faster than in previous studies and they also preferred to
  rake in rather than to push the reward out. There was no correlation in the level
  of performance between both tasks, and no indication of interspecies differences.
  These data are consistent with the idea that apes may possess some specific causal
  knowledge of traps but may lack the ability to establish analogical relations between
  functional equivalent tasks.
