  the effect of time and sleep. Biology Letters, 7(6), 829-832. doi:10.1098/rsbl.2011.0437.'
abstract: 'Following encoding, memory remains temporarily vulnerable to disruption.
  Consolidation refers to offline time-dependent processes that continue after encoding
  and stabilize, transform or enhance the memory trace. Memory consolidation resulting
  from sleep has been reported for declarative and non-declarative memories in humans.
  We first investigated the temporal course of memory retrieval in chimpanzees, bonobos
  and orangutans. We found that the amount of retrieved information was time dependent:
  apes'' performance degraded after 1 and 2 h, stabilized after 4 h, started to increase
  after 8 and 12 h and fully recovered after 24 h. Second, we show that although memories
  during wakefulness were highly vulnerable to interference from events similar to
  those witnessed during the original encoding event, an intervening period of sleep
  not only stabilized apes'' memories into more permanent ones but also protected
  them against interference.'
