abstract: Humans regularly provide others with resources at a personal cost to themselves.
  Chimpanzees engage in some cooperative behaviors in the wild as well, but their
  motivational underpinnings are unclear. In three experiments, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
  always chose between an option delivering food both to themselves and a partner
  and one delivering food only to themselves. In one condition, a conspecific partner
  had just previously taken a personal risk to make this choice available. In another
  condition, no assistance from the partner preceded the subject's decision. Chimpanzees
  made significantly more prosocial choices after receiving their partner's assistance
  than when no assistance was given (experiment 1) and, crucially, this was the case
  even when choosing the prosocial option was materially costly for the subject (experiment
  2). Moreover, subjects appeared sensitive to the risk of their partner's assistance
  and chose prosocially more often when their partner risked losing food by helping
  (experiment 3). These findings demonstrate experimentally that chimpanzees are willing
  to incur a material cost to deliver rewards to a conspecific, but only if that conspecific
  previously assisted them, and particularly when this assistance was risky. Some
  key motivations involved in human cooperation thus may have deeper phylogenetic
  roots than previously suspected.
