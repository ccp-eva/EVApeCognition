abstract: Research on colour preferences in humans and non-human primates suggests
  similar patterns of biases for and avoidance of specific colours, indicating that
  these colours are connected to a psychological reaction. Similarly, in the acoustic
  domain, approach reactions to consonant sounds (considered as positive) and avoidance
  reactions to dissonant sounds (considered as negative) have been found in human
  adults and children, and it has been demonstrated that non-human primates are able
  to discriminate between consonant and dissonant sounds. Yet it remains unclear whether
  the visual and acoustic approach-avoidance patterns remain consistent when both
  types of stimuli are combined, how they relate to and influence each other, and
  whether these are similar for humans and other primates. Therefore, to investigate
  whether gaze duration biases for colours are similar across primates and whether
  reactions to consonant and dissonant sounds cumulate with reactions to specific
  colours, we conducted an eye-tracking study in which we compared humans with one
  species of great apes, the orangutans. We presented four different colours either
  in isolation or in combination with consonant and dissonant sounds. We hypothesised
  that the viewing time for specific colours should be influenced by dissonant sounds
  and that previously existing avoidance behaviours with regard to colours should
  be intensified, reflecting their association with negative acoustic information.
  The results showed that the humans had constant gaze durations which were independent
  of the auditory stimulus, with a clear avoidance of yellow. In contrast, the orangutans
  did not show any clear gaze duration bias or avoidance of colours, and they were
  also not influenced by the auditory stimuli. In conclusion, our findings only partially
  support the previously identified pattern of biases for and avoidance of specific
  colours in humans and do not confirm such a pattern for orangutans.
