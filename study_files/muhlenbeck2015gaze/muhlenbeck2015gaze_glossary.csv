"recording_resolution","the resolution of the screen or of the video capture device used during the recording in pixels – horizontal x vertical"
"export_date","date when the file was exported "
"eye","indicates whether the data in that row corresponds to the left eye/ right eye/ or an average of both eyes (here: was average for all data)"
"validity","indicates the quality or reliability of gaze data for a given eye (here: all normal —> meaning that the data is of high quality and is considered reliable for analysis)"
"fixation_filter","the fixation filter applied when the data was exported/ I-VT filter/raw filter/tobii fixation filter/clearview filter"
"velocity_threshold","I-VT (Velocity Threshold Identification) algorithm – which classifies eye movements based on the speed (velocity) of gaze shifts (A common velocity threshold is 30°/s for distinguishing between fixations and saccades; here: we used 35 °/s for all data)"
"distance_threshold","used in event detection algorithms to classify eye movement (eg in I-DT: Dispersion-Threshold Identification algorithms. It is the maximum spatial dispersion allowed for gaze points to still be considered part of the same fixation. If the gaze moves beyond this threshold then a new fixation is registered"
"timestamp","precise time at which each data sample was recorded in ms"
"datetimestamp","time-of-day format (HH:MM:SS.sss) (not including the date as the variable indicates)"
"datetimestampstartoffset","indicates the offset or baseline time from which all subsequent datetimestamp values are measured"
"number","order of the data points as they were collected during the recording session"
"gazepointxleft","horizontal coordinate of the unprocessed gaze point for the left eye on the screen"
"gazepointyleft","vertical coordinate of the unprocessed gaze point for the left eye on the screen"
"camxleft","horizontal coordinate of the left eye in the eye tracker sensor image – only available for recordings made with tobii studio versions prior to tobii studio 2.3. 0 is the left edge of the image and 1 is the right edge."
"camyleft","vertical coordinate of the left eye in the eye tracker sensor image – only available for recordings made with tobii studio versions prior to tobii studio 2.3. 0 is the left edge of the image and 1 is the right edge."
"distanceleft","distance between the left eye and the eye tracker. The distance is calculated in millimeters based on the length of the vector from the center of the eye to the UCS origin point on the eye tracker"
"pupilleft","estimated size of the left eye pupil in millimeters. The Tobii eye trackers aim to measure the true pupil size (ie the algorithms take into account the magnification effect given by the psherical cornea as well as the distance to the eye)"
"validityleft","indicates the confidence level that the left eye has been correctly identified. The values range from 0 (high confidence) to 4 (eye not found) / format 0/1/2/3/4"
"gazepointxright","horizontal coordinate of the unprocessed gaze point for the right eye on the screen"
"gazepointyright","vertical coordinate of the unprocessed gaze point for the right eye on the screen"
"camxright","horizontal coordinate of the right eye in the eye tracker sensor image – only available for recordings made with tobii studio versions prior to tobii studio 2.3. 0 is the left edge of the image and 1 is the right edge."
"camyright","vertical coordinate of the right eye in the eye tracker sensor image – only available for recordings made with tobii studio versions prior to tobii studio 2.3. 0 is the left edge of the image and 1 is the right edge."
"distanceright","distance between the right eye and the eye tracker. The distance is calculated in millimeters based on the length of the vector from the center of the eye to the UCS origin point on the eye tracker"
"pupilright","estimated size of the right eye pupil in millimeters. The Tobii eye trackers aim to measure the true pupil size (ie the algorithms take into account the magnification effect given by the psherical cornea as well as the distance to the eye)"
"validityright","indicates the confidence level that the right eye has been correctly identified. The values range from 0 (high confidence) to 4 (eye not found) / format 0/1/2/3/4"

"mediaposy","vertical coordinate of the top edge of the eye tracked media in pixels using the ADCSpx reference system"
"mappedfixationpointx","horizontal coordinate of the fixation point on the media in pixels using the MCSpx system. If empty – fixation is outside media/media is covered/no media is displayed"
