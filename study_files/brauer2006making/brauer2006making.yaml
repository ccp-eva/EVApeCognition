  Making inferences about the location of hidden food: Social dog - casual ape. Journal
  of Comparative Psychology, 120(1), 38-47. doi:10.1037/0735-7036.120.1.38.'
abstract: Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and great apes from the genus Pan were
  tested on a series of object choice tasks. In each task, the location of hidden
  food was indicated for subjects by some kind of communicative, behavioral, or physical
  cue. On the basis of differences in the ecologies of these 2 genera, as well as
  on previous research, the authors hypothesized that dogs should be especially skillful
  in using human communicative cues such as the pointing gesture, whereas apes should
  be especially skillful in using physical, causal cues such as food in a cup making
  noise when it is shaken. The overall pattern of performance by the 2 genera strongly
  supported this social-dog, causal-ape hypothesis. This result is discussed in terms
  of apes’ adaptations for complex, extractive foraging and dogs’ adaptations, during
  the domestication process, for cooperative communication with humans.
