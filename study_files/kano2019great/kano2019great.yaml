  apes use self-experience to anticipate an agent’s action in a false-belief test.

abstract: Human social life depends on theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental
  states to oneself and others. A signature of theory of mind, false belief understanding,
  requires representing others’ views of the world, even when they conflict with one’s
  own. After decades of research, it remains controversial whether any nonhuman species
  possess a theory of mind. One challenge to positive evidence of animal theory of
  mind, the behavior-rule account, holds that animals solve such tasks by responding
  to others’ behavioral cues rather than their mental states. We distinguish these
  hypotheses by implementing a version of the “goggles” test, which asks whether,
  in the absence of any additional behavioral cues, animals can use their own self-experience
  of a novel barrier being translucent or opaque to determine whether another agent
  can see through the same barrier. We incorporated this paradigm into an established
  anticipatory-looking false-belief test for great apes. In a between-subjects design,
  apes experienced a novel barrier as either translucent or opaque, although both
  looked identical from afar. While being eye tracked, all apes then watched a video
  in which an actor saw an object hidden under 1 of 2 identical boxes. The actor then
  scuttled behind the novel barrier, at which point the object was relocated and then
  removed. Only apes who experienced the barrier as opaque visually anticipated that
  the actor would mistakenly search for the object in its previous location. Great
  apes, therefore, appeared to attribute differential visual access based specifically
  on their own past perceptual experience to anticipate an agent’s actions in a false-belief
  test
