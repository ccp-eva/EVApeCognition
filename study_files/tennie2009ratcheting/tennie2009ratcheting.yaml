abstract: Some researchers have claimed that chimpanzee and human culture rest on
  homologous cognitive and learning mechanisms. While clearly there are some homologous
  mechanisms, we argue here that there are some different mechanisms at work as well.
  Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations,
  all within the species’ existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the ‘zone of
  latent solutions’) that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and
  mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in
  contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over
  time (what we call the ‘ratchet effect’). This difference results from the facts
  that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and
  (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations
  for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique
  processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans’ unique form of cumulative
  cultural evolution.
