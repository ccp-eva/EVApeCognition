abstract: We investigated whether chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans encoded the
  location of a reward hidden underneath one of three identical cups in relation to
  (1) the other cups in the array—i.e., the relative position of the baited cup within
  the array; or (2) the landmarks surrounding the cups—e.g., the edge of the table.
  Apes witnessed the hiding of a food reward under one of three cups forming a straight
  line on a platform. After 30 s, they were allowed to search for the reward. In three
  different experiments, we varied the distance of the cups to the edge of the platform
  and the distance between the cups. Results showed that both manipulated variables
  affected apes’ retrieval accuracy. Subjects’ retrieval accuracy was higher for the
  outer cups compared with the Middle cup, especially if the outer cups were located
  next to the platform’s edge. Additionally, the larger the distance between the cups,
  the better performance became.
