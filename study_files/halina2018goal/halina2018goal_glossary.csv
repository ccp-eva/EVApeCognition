"study_id","personal study ID composed by the first authors’ first surname_year of publication_first title word "
"participant","name of the participant "
"sex","sex of the participant "
"species","species of individuals participating in the study -bonobo/chimpanzee"
"session","set of trials - mostly occurring on the same day - usually numerical "
"trial","presentation of the experiment to the participants – all motivational trials lasted 120 seconds even when all 5 grapes were attained earlier"
"condition","test conditions presented to the participant - two experimental failed-look and successful-look and one motivational - participants received maximum 5 grapes per session"
"start_time_in_seconds","time (in seconds) at which a pointing gesture begins
For coding purposes a pointing gesture includes extending a finger/hand/arm through the wire-mesh experimental window and directing it beyond without requiring eye contact with the experimenter. This definition applies to all subsequent variables that include pointing gesture"
"end_time_in_seconds","time (in seconds) at which a pointing gesture ends"
"point_duration_in_seconds","duration of a pointing gesture in seconds (end_time_s minus start_time_s)"
"hand","whether the pointing gesture is left-handed or right-handed"
"eye_contact","whether the participant made eye contact with the gestural recipient when pointing."
"point_direction","the location where a pointing gesture is directed relative to the experimenter"
"grape_position","The location of the grapes relative to the experimenter"
"correct","whether the pointing gesture is directed at the grapes (point_direction and grape_position match) or not (point_direction and grape_position fail to match)"
"object_received","whether the participant received a grape or grapeless grapevine."
"experimenter","which of three experimenters ran the trial."
