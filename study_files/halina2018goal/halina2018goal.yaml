abstract: Captive great apes regularly use pointing gestures in their interactions
  with humans. However, the precise function of this gesture is unknown. One possibility
  is that apes use pointing primarily to direct attention (as in “please look at that”);
  another is that they point mainly as an action request (such as “can you give that
  to me?”). We investigated these two possibilities here by examining how the looking
  behavior of recipients affects pointing in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos
  (Pan paniscus). Upon pointing to food, subjects were faced with a recipient who
  either looked at the indicated object (successful-look) or failed to look at the
  indicated object (failed-look). We predicted that, if apes point primarily to direct
  attention, subjects would spend more time pointing in the failed-look condition
  because the goal of their gesture had not been met. Alternatively, we expected that,
  if apes point primarily to request an object, subjects would not differ in their
  pointing behavior between the successful-look and failed-look conditions because
  these conditions differed only in the looking behavior of the recipient. We found
  that subjects did differ in their pointing behavior across the successful-look and
  failed-look conditions, but contrary to our prediction subjects spent more time
  pointing in the successful-look condition. These results suggest that apes are sensitive
  to the attentional states of gestural recipients, but their adjustments are aimed
  at multiple goals. We also found a greater number of individuals with a strong right-hand
  than left-hand preference for pointing.
