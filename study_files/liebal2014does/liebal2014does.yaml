abstract: Prosocial behaviours such as helping, comforting, or sharing are central
  to human social life. Because they emerge early in ontogeny, it has been proposed
  that humans are prosocial by nature and that from early on empathy and sympathy
  motivate such behaviours. The emerging question is whether humans share these abilities
  to feel with and for someone with our closest relatives, the great apes. Although
  several studies demonstrated that great apes help others, little is known about
  their underlying motivations. This study addresses this issue and investigates whether
  four species of great apes (Pongo pygmaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan
  paniscus) help a conspecific more after observing the conspecific being harmed (a
  human experimenter steals the conspecificâ€™s food) compared to a condition where
  no harming occurred. Results showed that in regard to the occurrence of prosocial
  behaviours, only orangutans, but not the African great apes, help others when help
  is needed, contrasting prior findings on chimpanzees. However, with the exception
  of one population of orangutans that helped significantly more after a conspecific
  was harmed than when no harm occurred, prosocial behaviour in great apes was not
  motivated by concern for others.
