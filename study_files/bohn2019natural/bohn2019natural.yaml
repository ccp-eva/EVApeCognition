abstract: The recognition of iconic correspondence between signal and referent has
  been argued to bootstrap the acquisition and emergence of language. Here, we study
  the ontogeny, and to some extent the phylogeny, of the ability to spontaneously
  relate iconic signals, gestures, and/or vocalizations, to previous experience. Children
  at 18, 24, and 36 months of age (N = 216) and great apes (N = 13) interacted with
  two apparatuses, each comprising a distinct action and sound. Subsequently, an experimenter
  mimicked either the action, the sound, or both in combination to refer to one of
  the apparatuses. Experiments 1 and 2 found no spontaneous comprehension in great
  apes and in 18-month- old children. At 24 months of age, children were successful
  with a composite vocalization-gesture signal but not with either vocalization or
  gesture alone. At 36 months, children succeeded both with a composite vocalization-gesture
  signal and with gesture alone, but not with vocalization alone. In general, gestures
  were understood better compared to vocalizations. Experiment 4 showed that gestures
  were understood irrespective of how children learned about the corresponding action
  (through observation or self-experience). This pattern of results demonstrates that
  iconic signals can be a powerful way to establish reference in the absence of language,
  but they are not trivial for children to comprehend and not all iconic signals are
  created equal.
