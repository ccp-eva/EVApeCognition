abstract: Sweet potato washing and wheat placer mining in Japanese macaques (Macaca
  fuscata) are among the most well known examples of local traditions in nonhuman
  animals. The functions of these behaviors and the mechanisms of acquisition and
  spread of these behaviors have been debated frequently. Prompted by animal caretaker
  reports that great apes [chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus),
  gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii)] at Leipzig Zoo occasionally
  wash their food, we conducted a study of food washing behaviors that consisted of
  two parts. In the first part we assessed the current distribution of the behavior
  on the basis of caretaker reports. In the second (experimental) part, we provided
  subjects individually with a water basin and two types of food (apples and cereal)
  that was either clean or covered/mixed with sand. We found that subjects of all
  species (except gorillas) placed apples in the water before consumption, and that
  they did so more often when the apples were dirty than when they were clean. Several
  chimpanzees and orangutans also engaged in behaviors resembling wheat placer mining.
