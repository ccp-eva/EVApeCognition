"trial_type","trial type = Transfer– different (TD): The experimenter presented a pair of the identical clear cups filled with different amounts of grape juice (20 ml and 50 ml) and let the participant select one of the containers. The first choice was necessary to confirm that the apes were motivated to select the larger quantity. After the first choice the experimenter transferred the contents of the clear cups into a clear dish and a clear tube. The participant was then allowed to make a second choice and given the contents of the selected container/ No-transfer– different (NTD): The experimenter presented the two different amounts of juice (20 ml and 50 ml) directly in the pair of the dish and tube from the beginning of the trials so that the participant could see only the end result of the transformation of the quantities. After the first choice the selected quantity was immediately given to the participant./ Transfer–same (TS): This condition was the same as the TD condition but with equal juice quantities (50 ml)./ No-transfer–same (NTS): This condition was the same as the NTD condition but with equal juice quantities (50 ml)./ No testing trial (NO) "
"ld_or_lt_trial","LD trial: In half of the trials the larger quantity was poured into the dish and the smaller quantity into the tube./ LT trial: in the other half the combination of the quantities and the shapes of the containers was reversed."
