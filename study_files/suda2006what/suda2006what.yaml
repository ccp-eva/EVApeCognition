abstract: 'The study investigates what an intermediate success rate means in bonobos,
  chimpanzees, and orangutans. Apes participated in liquid conservation experiments
  where they had to track the larger of two different quantities of juice after various
  kinds of transformations [Suda, C., & Call, J. (2004). Piagetian liquid conservation
  in the great apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, and Pongo pygmaeus). Journal of
  Comparative Psychology, 118, 265-279). When making a decision, apes sometimes demonstrated
  hesitant behavior, concurrently pointing to both alternatives or successively changing
  their choice. Moderately successful apes showed more hesitation than highly successful
  or unsuccessful apes. The results are consistent with the cognitive conflict model:
  The experiments created a higher degree of cognitive conflict on moderately successful
  apes than on very successful or unsuccessful apes. This indicates that an intermediate
  performance reflects the joint operation and potential conflict between two different
  cognitive strategies (identity and appearance) inherent to the Piagetian conservation
  task.'
