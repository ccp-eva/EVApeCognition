abstract: Social animals frequently rely on information from other individuals. This
  can be costly in case the other individual is mistaken or even deceptive. Human
  infants below 4 years of age show proficiency in their reliance on differently reliable
  informants. They can infer the reliability of an informant from few interactions
  and use that assessment in later interactions with the same informant in a different
  context. To explore whether great apes share that ability, in our study we confronted
  great apes with a reliable or unreliable informant in an object choice task, to
  see whether that would in a subsequent task affect their gaze following behaviour
  in response to the same informant. In our study, prior reliability of the informant
  and habituation during the gaze following task affected both great apesâ€™ automatic
  gaze following response and their more deliberate response of gaze following behind
  barriers. As habituation is very context specific, it is unlikely that habituation
  in the reliability task affected the gaze following task. Rather it seems that apes
  employ a reliability tracking strategy that results in a general avoidance of additional
  information from an unreliable informant.
