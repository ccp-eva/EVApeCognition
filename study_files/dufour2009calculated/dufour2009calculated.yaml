abstract: Transfers and services are frequent in the animal kingdom. However, there
  is no clear evidence in animals that such transactions are based on weighing costs
  and benefits when giving or returning favours and keeping track of them over time
  (i.e. calculated reciprocity). We tested two orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus abelii
  ) in a token-exchange paradigm, in which each individual could exchange a token
  for food with the experimenter but only after first obtaining the token from the
  other orang-utan. Each orang-utan possessed tokens valuable to their partner but
  useless to themselves. Both orangutans actively transferred numerous tokens (mostly
  partner-valuable) to their partner. One of the orang-utans routinely used gestures
  to request tokens while the other complied with such requests. Although initially
  the transfers were biased in one direction, they became more balanced towards the
  end of the study. Indeed, data on the last three series produced evidence of reciprocity
  both between and within trials. We observed an increase in the number and complexity
  of exchanges and alternations. This study is the first experimental demonstration
  of the occurrence of direct transfers of goods based on calculated reciprocity in
  non-human-primates.
