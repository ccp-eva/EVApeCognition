transfer_direct_banana_peel,variable referring to the number of transfers of a banana peel directly to the mouth or the hand of  participant_2
transfer_indirect_partner_value,variable referring to the number of transfers of a valuable token placed in the cage of the participant_2 but not directly to the mouth or the hand of participant_2
transfer_indirect_no_value_token,variable referring to the number of transfers of a token without value  in the cage of the participant_2 but not directly to the mouth or the hand of participant_2 
transfer_indirect_banana_peel,variable referring to the number of transfers of a banana peel  in the cage of participant_2 but not directly to the mouth or the hand of the participant_2
transfer_passive_partner_value,variable referring to the number of tokens of value for the participant_2 taken by the participant_2 from the participant side without the help of the participant

catch_banana_peel,variable referring to the number of banana peels taken by participant_2 from the participant side while the participant prevents the transfer
pointing_followed_by_valuable_token_transfer,variable referring to the number of pointing gestures followed by a number of tokens. Integers refer to X occurrence of the pointing each followed by the transfer of 1 valuable token.  For example the code 2x_1gesture_1token_and_1x_1gesture_and_2tokens should be read as 2 times 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of one token  and then 1 time 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of two tokens. When only one integer is introduced (eg. 3) it means there were 3 pointing occurrences followed by the transfer of one token
pointing_followed_by_nonvaluable_token_transfer,variable referring to the number of pointing gestures followed by a number of non value tokens. Integers refer to X occurrence of the pointing each followed by the transfer of 1 non valuable token.  For example the code 2x_1gesture_1token_and_1x_1gesture_and_2tokens should be read as 2 times 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of one token  and then 1 time 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of two tokens. When only one integer is introduced (eg. 3) it means there were 3 pointing occurrences followed by the transfer of one token
pointing_followed_by_nothing,variable referring to the number of pointing gestures followed by nothing
hand_beg_followed_by_valuable_token,variable referring to the number of begging gestures followed by a number of tokens. Integers refer to X occurrence of the hand begging each followed by the transfer of 1 valuable token. For example the code 2x_1gesture_1token_and_1x_1gesture_and_2tokens should be read as 2 times 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of one token  and then 1 time 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of two tokens. When only one integer is introduced (eg. 3) it means there were 3 pointing occurrences followed by the transfer of one token
hand_beg_followed_by_nonvaluable_token,variable referring to the number of begging gestures followed by a number of non value tokens. Integers refer to X occurrence of the hand begging each followed by the transfer of 1 non valuable token.  For example the code 2x_1gesture_1token_and_1x_1gesture_and_2tokens should be read as 2 times 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of one token  and then 1 time 1 pointing gesture followed by the transfer of two tokens. When only one integer is introduced (eg. 3) it means there were 3 pointing occurrences followed by the transfer of one token
hand_beg_followed_by_nothing,variable referring to the number of begging gestures followed by nothing
no_gesture_followed_by_valuable_token,variable referring to the number of no gestures followed by the transfer of tokens
no_gesture_followed_by_nonvaluable_token,variable referring to the number of no gestures followed by the transfer of non-value tokens
alternations_general ,number of times in which one transfer (valuable or not) is followed by a return – includes passive and excludes catches
alternations_valuable ,number of times in which one valuable transfer is followed by a valuable return (including banana peel)– includes passive and excludes catches
pagai_to_bimbo,transfers between two particular individuals( from pagai to bimbo) with a different type of behavior and which is presented different from the rest of the data 
bimbo_to_pagai ,transfers between two particular individuals( from bimbo to pagai) with a different type of behavior and which is presented different from the rest of the data
