abstract: Chimpanzees’ refusal of less-preferred food when an experimenter has previously
  provided preferred food to a conspecific has been taken as evidence for a sense
  of fairness. Here, we present a novel hypothesis—the social disappointment hypothesis—according
  to which food refusals express chimpanzees’ disappointment in the human experimenter
  for not rewarding them as well as they could have. We tested this hypothesis using
  a two-by two design in which food was either distributed by an experimenter or a
  machine and with a partner present or absent. We found that chimpanzees were more
  likely to reject food when it was distributed by an experimenter rather than by
  a machine and that they were not more likely to do so when a partner was present.
  These results suggest that chimpanzees’ refusal of less preferred food stems from
  social disappointment in the experimenter and not from a sense of fairness.
