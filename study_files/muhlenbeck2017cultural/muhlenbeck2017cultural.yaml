abstract: Objects from the Middle Paleolithic period colored with ochre and marked
  with incisions represent the beginning of non-utilitarian object manipulation in
  different species of the Homo genus. To investigate the visual effects caused by
  these markings, we compared humans who have different cultural backgrounds (Namibian
  hunter–gatherers and German city dwellers) to one species of non-human great apes
  (orangutans) with respect to their perceptions of markings on objects. We used eye-tracking
  to analyze their fixation patterns and the durations of their fixations on marked
  and unmarked stones and sticks. In an additional test, humans evaluated the objects
  regarding their aesthetic preferences. Our hypotheses were that colorful markings
  help an individual to structure the surrounding world by making certain features
  of the environment salient, and that aesthetic appreciation should be associated
  with this structuring. Our results showed that humans fixated on the marked objects
  longer and used them in the structural processing of the objects and their background,
  but did not consistently report finding them more beautiful. Orangutans, in contrast,
  did not distinguish between object and background in their visual processing and
  did not clearly fixate longer on the markings. Our results suggest that marking
  behavior is characteristic for humans and evolved as an attention-directing rather
  than aesthetic benefit.
