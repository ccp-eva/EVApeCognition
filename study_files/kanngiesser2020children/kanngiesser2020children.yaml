abstract: Access to and control of resources is a major source of costly conflicts.
  Animals, under some conditions, respect what others control and use (i.e. possession).
  Humans not only respect possession of resources, they also respect ownership. Ownership
  can be viewed as a cooperative arrangement, where individuals inhibit their tendency
  to take othersâ€™ property on the condition that those others will do the same. We
  investigated to what degree great apes follow this principle, as compared to human
  children. We conducted two experiments, in which dyads of individuals could access
  the same food resources. The main test of respect for ownership was whether individuals
  would refrain from taking their partner's resources even when the partner could
  not immediately access and control them. Captive apes (N = 14 dyads) failed to respect
  their partner's claim on food resources and frequently monopolized the resources
  when given the opportunity. Human children (N = 14 dyads), tested with a similar
  apparatus and procedure, respected their partner's claim and made spontane- ous
  verbal references to ownership. Such respect for the property of others highlights
  the uniquely cooperative nature of human ownership arrangements.
