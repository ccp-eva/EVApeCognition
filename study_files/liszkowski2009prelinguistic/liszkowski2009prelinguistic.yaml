abstract: One of the defining features of human language is displacement, the ability
  to make reference to absent entities. Here we show that prelinguistic, 12-month-old
  infants already can use a nonverbal pointing gesture to make reference to absent
  entities. We also show that chimpanzees-who can point for things they want humans
  to give them-do not point to refer to absent entities in the same way. These results
  demonstrate that the ability to communicate about absent but mutually known entities
  depends not on language, but rather on deeper social-cognitive skills that make
  acts of linguistic reference possible in the first place. These nonlinguistic skills
  for displaced reference emerged apparently only after humans' divergence from great
  apes some 6 million years ago.
