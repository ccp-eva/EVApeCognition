  copy more reliably and more often than nonhuman great apes in multiple observational

abstract: 'Individuals observing a proficient model can potentially benefit by copying
  at least one of the following three elements: motor movements (i.e., actions), goals,
  and results. Although several studies have investigated this issue in human infants,
  there are still very few studies that have systematically examined great apes’ ability
  to spontaneously copy each of these three elements (particularly in comparison with
  human infants). We tested great apes and human children with eight two-target puzzle
  boxes—with varying levels of difficulty—to isolate the aspects that the various
  species may be more prone to copying. We found first trial evidence for observational
  learning of actions, goals, and results in children. Some copying was found for
  apes as well, but only if their performance was averaged across trials.'
