abstract: The ability to predict how another individual will behave is useful in social
  competition. Chimpanzees can predict the behaviour of another based on what they
  observe her to see, hear, know and infer. Here we show that chimpanzees act on the
  assumption that others have preferences that match their own. All subjects began
  with a preference for a box with a picture of food over one with a picture of nothing,
  even though the pictures had no causal relation to the contents. In a back-and-forth
  food competition, chimpanzees then avoided the box with the picture of food when
  their competitor had chosen one of the boxes before them-presumably on the assumption
  that the competitor shared their own preference for it and had already chosen it.
  Chimpanzees predicted that their competitor's preference would match their own and
  adjusted their behavioural strategies accordingly.
