abstract: Many studies investigate the decisions made by animals by focusing on their
  attitudes toward risk, that is, risk-seeking, risk neutrality, or risk aversion.
  However, little attention has been paid to the extent to which individuals understand
  the different odds of outcomes. In a previous gambling task involving 18 different
  lotteries (Pel√©, Broihanne, Thierry, Call, & Dufour, 2014), nonhuman primates used
  probabilities of gains and losses to make their decision. Although the use of complex
  mathematical calculation for decision-making seemed unlikely, we applied a gradual
  decrease in the chances to win throughout the experiment. This probably facilitated
  the extraction of information about odds. Here, we investigated whether individuals
  would still make efficient decisions if this facilitating factor was removed. To
  do so, we randomized the order of presentation of the 18 lotteries. Individuals
  from 4 ape and 2 monkey species were tested. Only capuchin monkeys differed from
  others, gambling even when there was nothing to win. Randomizing the lottery presentation
  order leads all species to predominantly use a maximax heuristic. Individuals gamble
  as soon as there is at least one chance to win more than they already possess, whatever
  the risk. Most species also gambled more as the frequency of larger rewards increased.
  These results suggest optimistic behavior. The maximax heuristic is sometimes observed
  in human managerial and financial decision-making, where risk is ignored for potential
  gains, however low they may be. This suggests a shared and strong propensity in
  primates to rely on heuristics whenever complexity in evaluation of outcome odds
  arises.
