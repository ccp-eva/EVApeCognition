abstract: Betty the crow astonished the scientific world as she spontaneously crafted
  hook-tools from straight wire in order to lift a basket out of vertical tubes. Recently
  it was suggested that this speciesâ€™ solution was strongly influenced by predispositions
  from behavioural routines from habitual hook-tool manufacture. Nevertheless, the
  task became a paradigm to investigate tool innovation. Considering that young humans
  had surprising difficulties with the task, it was yet unclear whether the innovation
  of a hooked tool would be feasible to primates that lacked habitual hook making.
  We thus tested five captive orangutans in a hook bending and unbending task. Orangutans
  are habitually tool-using primates that have been reported to use but not craft
  hooked tools for locomotion in the wild. Two orangutans spontaneously innovated
  hook tools and four unbent the wire from their first trial on. Pre-experience with
  ready-made hooks had some effect but did not lead to continuous success. Further
  subjects improved the hook-design feature when the task required the subjects to
  bent the hook at a steeper angle. Our results indicate that the ability to represent
  and manufacture tools according to a current need does not require stereotyped behavioural
  routines, but can indeed arise innovatively. Furthermore, the present study shows
  that the capacity for hook tool innovation is not limited to large brained birds
  within non-human animals.
