"participant","name of the participant "
"sex","sex of the participant "
"species","species of individuals participating in the study -bonobo/chimpanzee/gorilla/orangutan "
"session","set of trials - mostly occurring on the same day - usually numerical "
"trial","presentation of the experiment to the participants - usually numerical (just the successful trials for the unbending task-version ) "
"condition","two tubes placed with only one with reward: bending task- tubes vertically oriented with a non-functional string and a straight wire to create a hook; Unbending task - tubes horizontally oriented with a bend non-functional string and a bend wire. Participants need to unbend the wire to get access to the reward."
"first_task","type of first condition"
"received_preexperience_during_this_study","whether the participants received  stepwise scaffolding experience during the study"
"preexperience_with_raking_tools_during_previous_studies","whether the participants had experience with raking tools prior to the start of the experiment "
"condition_basket_fixed","whether the basket was fixed on the bottom of the tube with velcro fastener "
"time_until_success_excluding_time_when_subject_was_not_interacting_with_material_apparatus_in_seconds","time from first touch of one of the two materials until reaching the reward"
"duration_probing_with_unmodified_tool_in_seconds","time participant spent with tool - probing with the straight wire in the bending task/ probing with the v-shaped wire in the unbending task"
"duration_of_probing_with_functional_modified_tool_in_seconds","time participant spent probing (defined as one end of wire inserted into the tube) with functional tool "
"duration_of_probing_with_modified_non_functional_tool_in_seconds","time participant spent probing with non functional modified tool"
"latency_between_start_and_first_modification_wire_in_seconds","latency from participants entering the test compartment until first modification of the wire occurred"
"tool_crafting_time_excluding_interruptions_in_seconds","duration spent modifying the wire"
"place_of_modification","at apparatus or elsewhere"
"technique_used","technique used to modify wire - Bending task: s = bending with fingers inside the tube while the wire was inserted / r = bending with mouth while holding with hand/ q = bending on rim of the tube/ u = bending with hands - Unbending task: s = unbending while the wire was inserted in the tube/ r = unbending with mouth while holding with hand/ v = unbending with hands/ q = unbending with mouth"
"tool_turned_around"," whether the wire was turned around "
"how_often_tool_turned_around","how often the wire was turned around"
"string_touched","whether the string was touched or not "

"wire_inserted_in_wrong_tube","whether the string was inserted in the wrong tube (without food reward)"
"duration_of_wrong_insertion_in_seconds","time the string was inserted in the unabated tube"
"string_inserted","whether the string was inserted in the tube"
"duration_of_string_insertion_in_seconds","duration of string insertion"
"latency_between_start_and_first_touch_wire_in_seconds","latency between start of the trial and first touch of the wire "
