  A test of the submentalizing hypothesis: Apes'' performance in a false belief task
  inanimate control. Communicative & Integrative Biology, 10(4): e1343771. doi:10.1080/19420889.2017.1343771.'
abstract: Much debate concerns whether any nonhuman animals share with humans the
  ability to infer others' mental states, such as desires and beliefs. In a recent
  eye-tracking false-belief task, we showed that great apes correctly anticipated
  that a human actor would search for a goal object where he had last seen it, even
  though the apes themselves knew that it was no longer there. In response, Heyes
  proposed that apes' looking behavior was guided not by social cognitive mechanisms
  but rather domain-general cueing effects, and suggested the use of inanimate controls
  to test this alternative submentalizing hypothesis. In the present study, we implemented
  the suggested inanimate control of our previous false-belief task. Apes attended
  well to key events but showed markedly fewer anticipatory looks and no significant
  tendency to look to the correct location. We thus found no evidence that submentalizing
  was responsible for apes' anticipatory looks in our false-belief task.
