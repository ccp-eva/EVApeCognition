abstract: Eight chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), five bonobos (Pan paniscus), five gorillas
  (Gorilla gorilla), and seven orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) were presented with two
  invisible object displacement tasks. In full view of the subject, a food item was
  hidden under one of three opaque cups resting on a platform and, after an experimental
  manipulation, the subject was allowed to select one of the cups. In the rotation
  task, the platform was rotated 1801 while the subject remained stationary. In the
  translocation task, the platform remained stationary while the subject walked to
  the opposite side from where she saw the reward being hidden. The final position
  of the food relative to the subject was equivalent in both tasks. Single displacement
  trials consisted of only one manipulation, either a rotation or a translocation,
  whereas double displacement trials consisted of both a rotation and a translocation.
  We also included no displacement trials in which no displacements took place. No
  displacement trials were easier than single displacements which, in turn, were easier
  than double displacements. Unlike earlier studies with children, there was no difference
  in performance between rotation and translocation displacements. Overall, apes performed
  above chance in all conditions, but chimpanzees outperformed the other species.
  This study reinforces the notion that the great apes use an allocentric spatial
  coding. Am. J. Primatol. 72:349â€“359, 2010.
