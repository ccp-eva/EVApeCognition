abstract: Cultural species can - or even prefer to - learn their skills from conspecifics.
  According to the cultural intelligence hypothesis, selection on underlying mechanisms
  not only improves this social learning ability but also the asocial (individual)
  learning ability. Thus, species with systematically richer opportunities to socially
  acquire knowledge and skills should over time evolve to become more intelligent.
  We experimentally compared the problem-solving ability of Sumatran orang-utans (Pongo
  abelii), which are sociable in the wild, with that of the closely related, but more
  solitary Bornean orangutans (P. pygmaeus), under the homogeneous environmental conditions
  provided by zoos. Our results revealed that Sumatrans showed superior innate problem-solving
  skills to Borneans, and also showed greater inhibition and a more cautious and less
  rough exploration style. This pattern is consistent with the cultural intelligence
  hypothesis, which predicts that the more sociable of two sister species experienced
  stronger selection on cognitive mechanisms underlying learning.
