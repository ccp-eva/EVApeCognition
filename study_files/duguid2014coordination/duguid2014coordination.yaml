abstract: Much of human cooperation takes place in mutualistic contexts in which the
  main challenge for individuals is how to coordinate decisions. In the current studies,
  we compared the abilities of chimpanzees and young children to coordinate with a
  partner in two versions of a Stag Hunt game. When risks were low (the hare was of
  low value) and information was cheap (the partner's behaviour was readily observable),
  partners of both species were able to successfully coordinate on the higher value
  stag more than 90% of the time. By contrast, when the risks were raised and observing
  the partner was more difficult, the chimpanzees became less successful, whereas
  the children compensated, and so remained highly successful, by communicating more
  often and more specifically. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis
  that humans evolved unique skills of coordination and communication in the context
  of especially risky coordination problems.
