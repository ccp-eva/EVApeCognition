abstract: Symmetric structures are of importance in relation to aesthetic preference.
  To investigate whether the preference for symmetric patterns is unique to humans,
  independent of their cultural background, we compared two human populations with
  distinct cultural backgrounds (Namibian hunter-gatherers and German town dwellers)
  with one species of non-human great apes (Orangutans) in their viewing behavior
  regarding symmetric and asymmetric patterns in two levels of complexity. In addition,
  the human participants were asked to give their aesthetic evaluation of a subset
  of the presented patterns. The results showed that humans of both cultural groups
  fixated on symmetric patterns for a longer period of time, regardless of the pattern's
  complexity. On the contrary, Orangutans did not clearly differentiate between symmetric
  and asymmetric patterns, but were much faster in processing the presented stimuli
  and scanned the complete screen, while both human groups rested on the symmetric
  pattern after a short scanning time. The aesthetic evaluation test revealed that
  the fixation preference for symmetric patterns did not match with the aesthetic
  evaluation in the Hai//om group, whereas in the German group aesthetic evaluation
  was in accordance with the fixation preference in 60 percent of the cases. It can
  be concluded that humans prefer well-ordered structures in visual processing tasks,
  most likely because of a positive processing bias for symmetry, which Orangutans
  did not show in this task, and that, in humans, an aesthetic preference does not
  necessarily accompany the fixation preference.
