abstract: When viewing social scenes, humans and nonhuman primates focus on particular
  features, such as the models’ eyes, mouth, and action targets. Previous studies
  reported that such viewing patterns vary significantly across individuals in humans,
  and also across closely-related primate species. However, the nature of these individual
  and species differences remains unclear, particularly among nonhuman primates. In
  large samples of human and nonhuman primates, we examined species differences and
  the effects of experience on patterns of gaze toward social movies. Experiment 1
  examined the species differences across rhesus macaques, nonhuman apes (bonobos,
  chimpanzees, and orangutans), and humans while they viewed movies of various animals’
  species-typical behaviors. We found that each species had distinct viewing patterns
  of the models’ faces, eyes, mouths, and action targets. Experiment 2 tested the
  effect of individuals’ experience on chimpanzee and human viewing patterns. We presented
  movies depicting natural behaviors of chimpanzees to three groups of chimpanzees
  (individuals from a zoo, a sanctuary, and a research institute) differing in their
  early social and physical experiences. We also presented the same movies to human
  adults and children differing in their expertise with chimpanzees (experts vs. novices)
  or movie-viewing generally (adults vs. preschoolers). Individuals varied within
  each species in their patterns of gaze toward models’ faces, eyes, mouths, and action
  targets depending on their unique individual experiences. We thus found that the
  viewing patterns for social stimuli are both individual- and species-specific in
  these closely-related primates. Such individual/species-specificities are likely
  related to both individual experience and species-typical temperament, suggesting
  that primate individuals acquire their unique attentional biases through both ontogeny
  and evolution. Such unique attentional biases may help them learn efficiently about
  their particular social environments.
