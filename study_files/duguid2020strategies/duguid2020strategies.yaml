  used by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens) to solve a simple
  coordination problem. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 134(4), 401-411. doi:10.1037/com0000220.
abstract: One of the challenges of collaboration is to coordinate decisions with others,
  and recent theories have proposed that humans, in particular, evolved skills to
  address this challenge. To test this hypothesis, we compared the coordination abilities
  of 4-year-old children and chimpanzees with a simple coordination problem. To retrieve
  a reward from a 'puzzle box', pairs of individuals were simply required to choose
  the same 1 of 4 options. If successful, they each received the same reward, so there
  were no conflicts of interest. Individuals were paired with multiple partners over
  time. Both species were able to coordinate, but there were marked differences in
  the way they did so. Children were able to coordinate quickly and flexibly, adjusting
  easily to new partners, suggesting an understanding of the coordination process.
  In contrast, chimpanzees took time to converge on a single solution with each new
  partner, with no gains across partners, suggesting that their coordination was based
  only on repeating successful past choices. Together, these results support the hypothesis
  that humans have evolved unique skills for coordinating decisions and actions with
  others in the pursuit of common interests.
