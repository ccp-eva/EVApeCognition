abstract: Brosnan et al. (Brosnan, S. F., Schiff, H. C. & deWaal, F. B. M. 2005 Tolerance
  for inequity may increase with social closeness in chimpanzees. Proc. R. Soc. B
  272, 253–258) found that chimpanzees showed increased levels of rejection for less-preferred
  food when competitors received better food than themselves and postulated as an
  explanation inequity aversion. In the present study, we extended these findings
  by adding important control conditions, and we investigated whether inequity aversion
  could also be found in the other great ape species and whether it would be influenced
  by subjects’ relationship with the competitor. In the present study, subjects showed
  a pattern of food rejection opposite to the subjects of the above study by Brosnan
  et al. (2005). Our apes ignored fewer food pieces and stayed longer in front of
  the experimenter when a conspecific received better food than themselves. Moreover,
  chimpanzees begged more vigorously when the conspecific got favoured food. The most
  plausible explanation for these results is the food expectation hypothesis—seeing
  another individual receive high-quality food creates the expectation of receiving
  the same food oneself—and not inequity aversion.
