abstract: We investigate decision-making behaviour in all four non-human great ape
  species. Apes chose between a safe and a risky option across trials of varying expected
  values. All species chose the safe option more often with decreasing probability
  of success. While all species were risk-seeking, orangutans and chimpanzees chose
  the risky option more often than gorillas and bonobos. Hence all four species’ preferences
  were ordered in a manner consistent with normative dictates of expected value, but
  varied predictably in their willingness to take risks.
