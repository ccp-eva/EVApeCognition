  Dogs (Canis familiaris), but Not Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Understand Imperative
  Pointing. PLoS One, 7(2): e30913. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030913.'
abstract: Chimpanzees routinely follow the gaze of humans to outside targets. However,
  in most studies using object choice they fail to use communicative gestures (e.g.
  pointing) to find hidden food. Chimpanzees' failure to do this may be due to several
  difficulties with this paradigm. They may, for example, misinterpret the gesture
  as referring to the opaque cup instead of the hidden food. Or perhaps they do not
  understand informative communicative intentions. In contrast, dogs seem to be skilful
  in using human communicative cues in the context of finding food, but as of yet
  there is not much data showing whether they also use pointing in the context of
  finding non-food objects. Here we directly compare chimpanzees' (N = 20) and dogs'
  (N = 32) skills in using a communicative gesture directed at a visible object out
  of reach of the human but within reach of the subject. Pairs of objects were placed
  in view of and behind the subjects. The task was to retrieve the object the experimenter
  wanted. To indicate which one she desired, the experimenter pointed imperatively
  to it and directly rewarded the subject for handing over the correct one. While
  dogs performed well on this task, chimpanzees failed to identify the referent. Implications
  for great apes' and dogs' understanding of human communicative intentions are discussed
