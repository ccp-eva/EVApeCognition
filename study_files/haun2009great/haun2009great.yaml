abstract: Recognizing relational similarity relies on the ability to understand that
  defining object properties might not lie in the objects individually, but in the
  relations of the properties of various object to each other. This aptitude is highly
  relevant for many important human skills such as language, reasoning, categorization
  and understanding analogy and metaphor. In the current study, we investigated the
  ability to recognize relational similarities by testing five species of great apes,
  including human children in a spatial task. We found that all species performed
  better if related elements are connected by logico-causal as opposed to non-causal
  relations. Further, we find that only children above 4 years of age, bonobos and
  chimpanzees, unlike younger children, gorillas and orangutans display some mastery
  of reasoning by non-causal relational similarity. We conclude that recognizing relational
  similarity is not in its entirety unique to the human species. The lack of a capability
  for language does not prohibit recognition of simple relational similarities. The
  data are discussed in the light of the phylogenetic tree of relatedness of the great
  apes.
