  problem solving in great apes: The role of visual feedback in the floating peanut
  task. Animal Cognition, 22(5), 791-805. doi:10.1007/s10071-019-01275-0.'
abstract: 'Nonhuman great apes show remarkable behavioural flexibility. Some individuals
  are even able to use water as a tool: They spit water into a vertical tube to make
  a peanut float upwards until it comes into reach (floating peanut task; FPT). In
  the current study, we used the FPT to investigate how visual feedback, an end-state
  demonstration and a social demonstration affect task performance in nonhuman great
  apes in three experiments. Our results indicate that apes who had acquired the solution
  with a clear tube maintained it with an opaque one. However, apes starting with
  an opaque tube failed to solve the task. Additionally, facing the peanut floating
  on a water-filled tube (i.e., an end-state demonstration) promoted success independent
  on the availability of visual feedback. Moreover, experiencing how water was poured
  into the tube either by a human demonstrator or by a water tap that had been opened
  either by the ape or a human did not seem to be of further assistance. First, this
  study suggests that great apes require visual feedback for solving the FPT, which
  is no longer required after the initial acquisition. Second, some subjects benefit
  from encountering the end-state, a finding corroborating previous studies.'
