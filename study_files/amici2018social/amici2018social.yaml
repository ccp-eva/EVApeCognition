abstract: The ability to inhibit previously employed strategies and fexibly adjust
  behavioural responses to external conditions may be critical for individual survival.
  However, it is unclear which factors predict their distribution across species.
  Here, we investigated social inhibition and behavioural fexibility in six primate
  species (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, capuchin monkeys and spider
  monkeys) difering in terms of phylogenetic relatedness, foraging ecology and social
  organization. Depending on the social context, individuals could maximize their
  food intake by inhibiting the selection of a larger food reward in one condition
  (i.e. inhibition), but not in others, which required them to fexibly switching strategies
  across conditions (i.e. behavioural fexibility). Overall, our study revealed inter
  specifc diferences in social inhibition and behavioural fexibility, which partially
  refected diferences in fssion-fusion dynamics. In particular, orangutans and chimpanzees
  showed the highest level of inhibitory skills, while gorillas and capuchin monkeys
  showed the lowest one. In terms of behavioural fexibility, orangutans and spider
  monkeys were the best performers, while bonobos and capuchin monkeys were the worst
  ones. These results contribute to our understanding that inhibition and behavioural
  fexibility may be linked in more complex ways than usually thought, although both
  abilities play a crucial role in efcient problem solving
