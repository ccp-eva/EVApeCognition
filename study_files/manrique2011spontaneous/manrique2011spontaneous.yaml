abstract: Great apes can use multiple tools to extract food embedded in substrates
  and can invent new ways to exploit those resources. We tested five bonobos, five
  chimpanzees, and six orangutans in a task in which they had to use (and modify)
  a tool as a straw to drink the juice located inside a container. Experiment 1 showed
  that four orangutans and one chimpanzee invented the use of a piece of electric
  cable to get the juice. Experiment 2 investigated whether subjects could transform
  a non-functional hose into a functional one by removing blockages that impeded the
  free flow of juice. Orangutans outperformed chimpanzees and bonobos by differentially
  removing those blockages that prevented the flow of juice, often doing so before
  attempting to extract the juice. In Experiment 3, we presented chimpanzees and orangutans
  with four 3-tool sets (each tool set contained a single straw-like tool) and allowed
  them to select one tool. Unlike chimpanzees, orangutans succeeded in selecting the
  straw-like tool above chance levels without having to physically manipulate it.
  We suggest that orangutans' superior performance is related to their greater reliance
  on mouth actions during foraging. Experiment 4 investigated whether orangutans were
  also capable of selecting the suitable tool not by its appearance, but by the effects
  that it produced. After witnessing the experimenter blow bubbles or absorb liquid
  with a functional tool but fail to accomplish the same thing with the non-functional
  tool, orangutans failed to select the functional tool above chance levels.
