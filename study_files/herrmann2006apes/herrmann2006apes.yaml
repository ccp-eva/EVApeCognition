abstract: 'Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) (Study 1) and
  18- and 24-month-old human children (Study 2) participated in a novel communicative
  task. A human experimenter (E) hid food or a toy in one of two opaque containers
  before gesturing towards the reward’s location in one of two ways. In the Informing
  condition, she attempted to help the subject find the hidden object by simply pointing
  to the correct container. In the Prohibiting condition, E held out her arm toward
  the correct container (palm out) and told the subject firmly ‘Don’t take this one.’
  As in previous studies, the apes were at chance in the Informing condition. However,
  they were above chance in the new Prohibiting condition. Human 18-month-olds showed
  this same pattern of results, whereas 24-month-olds showed the opposite pattern:
  they were better in the Informing condition than in the Prohibiting condition. In
  our interpretation, success in the Prohibiting condition requires subjects to understand
  E’s goal toward them and their behavior, and then to make an inference (she would
  only prohibit if there were something good in there). Success in the Informing condition
  requires subjects to understand a cooperative communicative motive – which apparently
  apes and young infants find difficult.'
