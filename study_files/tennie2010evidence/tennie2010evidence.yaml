abstract: 'Background: It is still unclear which observational learning mechanisms
  underlie the transmission of difficult problem-solving skills in chimpanzees. In
  particular, two different mechanisms have been proposed: imitation and emulation.
  Previous studies have largely failed to control for social factors when these mechanisms
  were targeted., Methods: In an attempt to resolve the existing discrepancies, we
  adopted the ''floating peanut task'', in which subjects need to spit water into
  a tube until it is sufficiently full for floating peanuts to be grasped. In a previous
  study only a few chimpanzees were able to invent the necessary solution (and they
  either did so in their first trials or never). Here we compared success levels in
  baseline tests with two experimental conditions that followed: 1) A full model condition
  to test whether social demonstrations would be effective, and 2) A social emulation
  control condition, in which a human experimenter poured water from a bottle into
  the tube, to test whether results information alone (present in both experimental
  conditions) would also induce successes. Crucially, we controlled for social factors
  in both experimental conditions. Both types of demonstrations significantly increased
  successful spitting, with no differences between demonstration types. We also found
  that younger subjects were more likely to succeed than older ones. Our analysis
  showed that mere order effects could not explain our results., Conclusion: The full
  demonstration condition (which potentially offers additional information to observers,
  in the form of actions), induced no more successes than the emulation condition.
  Hence, emulation learning could explain the success in both conditions. This finding
  has broad implications for the interpretation of chimpanzee traditions, for which
  emulation learning may perhaps suffice.'
