abstract: The ability to suppress and/or change behaviour on the basis of negative
  feedback, often conceptualized as cognitive flexibility, has rarely been investigated
  in nonhuman great apes across a broad age range. In this study, 25 chimpanzees,
  Pan troglodytes, eight bonobos, Pan paniscus, seven orang-utans, Pongo abelii, and
  three gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, whose ages ranged from 5 to 48 years, were presented
  with a transparent Plexiglas rectangular box horizontally attached to their cage
  mesh. A square container, 7.5 cm2, fixed inside the apparatus contained a food reward
  (i.e. a grape). While the container rested on its central position the grape was
  not accessible. To retrieve the grape the subjects needed to grasp the handle connected
  to the reward container and displace it sideways to reach one of the lateral access
  windows. Subjects were intensively trained to displace the handle to a specific
  side (right or left, depending on the group) and then the rewarded side was reversed
  during the test. Performance in this reversal task did not differ significantly
  between species. However, a U-shaped relation between age and perseverative responding
  (i.e. moves to the previously rewarded side) was observed, extending findings with
  humans to our closest living primate relatives.
