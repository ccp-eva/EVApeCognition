abstract: Innovation has been defined as a solution to a novel problem or a novel
  solution to an old problem. The second part of this definition requires the inhibition
  of previously learnt solution strategies before a novel solution can be found. Therefore,
  inventing novel solutions for an old problem is considered to be particularly difficult.
  We investigated the ability of great apes to produce multiple new solutions to a
  task after each of those solutions became obsolete. We presented all four nonhuman
  great ape species with a task consisting of extracting a food reward from a puzzle
  box. Initially, the task could be solved in three different ways that varied in
  difficulty. After subjects discovered the first solution, we allowed them to use
  it for some trials and then it became obsolete. If the apes could overcome their
  initial response and find the next solution, we again allowed them to use it for
  some time and once again it became obsolete. The final step consisted of finding
  the third solution to secure the food reward. We found that all species except orang-utans,
  Pongo abelii, were able to solve all versions of the problem. Furthermore, they
  overcame the obsolete techniques quickly and efficiently, indicating high degrees
  of behavioural flexibility and inhibitory control. In contrast to previous research
  on social learning, our results suggest that great apes are not conservative and
  adjust their behaviour flexibly when the physical constraints of a task change.
