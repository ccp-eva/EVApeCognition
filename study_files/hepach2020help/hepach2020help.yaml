abstract: Humans, including young children, are strongly motivated to help others,
  even paying a cost to do so. Humans’ nearest primate relatives, great apes, are
  likewise motivated to help others, raising the question of whether the motivations
  of humans and apes are the same. Here we compared the underlying motivation to help
  in human children and chimpanzees. Both species understood the situation and helped
  a conspecific in a straightforward situation. However, when helpers knew that what
  the other was requesting would not actually help her, only children gave her what
  she needed instead of giving her what she requested. These results suggest that
  both chimpanzees and human children help others but the underlying motivation for
  why they help differs. In comparison to chimpanzees, young children help in a paternalistic
  manner. The evolutionary hypothesis is that uniquely human socio-ecologies based
  on interdependent cooperation gave rise to uniquely human prosocial motivations
  to help others paternalistically.
