abstract: Although previous studies have shown that many species follow gaze, few
  have directly compared closely related species, and thus its cross-species variation
  remains largely unclear. In this study, we compared three great ape species (bonobos,
  Pan paniscus, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, orang-utans, Pongo abelii) and humans
  (12-month-olds and adults) in their gaze-following responses to the videos of conspecific
  and allospecific models. In the video, the model turned his head repeatedly to one
  of two identical objects. We used a noninvasive eye-tracking technique to measure
  participants' eye movements, and used both conspecific and allospecific models as
  stimuli to examine their potential preference in following conspecific rather than
  allospecific gaze. Experiment 1 presented to great apes the videos of conspecific
  and human models. We found that all species followed the conspecific gaze. Chimpanzees
  did not follow the human gaze, whereas bonobos did. Bonobos reacted overall more
  sensitively than chimpanzees to both conspecific and human gaze. Experiment 2 presented
  to human infants and adults the videos of human, chimpanzee and orang-utan models.
  Both infants and adults followed the human gaze. Unlike adults, infants did not
  follow the ape gaze. Experiment 3 presented to great apes the videos of allospecific
  ape models. Consistent with experiment 1, chimpanzees did not follow the allospecific
  ape gaze, whereas bonobos and orang-utans did. Importantly, preferential following
  of conspecific gaze by chimpanzees (experiment 1) and human infants (experiment
  2) was mainly explained by their prolonged viewing of the conspecific face and thus
  seems to reflect their motivation to attend selectively to the conspecific models.
  Taken together, we conclude that gaze following is modulated by both subject species
  and model species in great apes and humans, presumably a reflection of the subjects'
  intrinsic sensitivity to gaze and also their selective interest in particular models.
