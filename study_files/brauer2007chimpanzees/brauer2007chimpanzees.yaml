abstract: Chimpanzee’s perspective-taking abilities are currently disputed. Here we
  show that in some food competition contexts, subordinate chimpanzees do take the
  visual perspective of dominant individuals, preferentially targeting a hidden piece
  of the food that the dominant cannot see over a piece that is visible to both individuals.
  However, the space where the animals compete is critical in determining whether
  subjects demonstrate this skill. We suggest that competition intensity, as mediated
  by these spatial factors, may play an important role in determining the strategy
  chimpanzees utilize in competitive contexts. Since some strategies may not require
  visual perspective taking in order to be successful, chimpanzees may not always
  demonstrate this skill. Differences in spatial arrangement may therefore account
  for the conflicting results of past studies.
