"inhibition_middlecup","ratio between the percentage of correct choices in experimental and control trials in the middle cup task - in experimental trials a correct choice is coded when individuals do not choose the empty opaque cup close to an opaque cup from which a food reward has been previously retrieved"
"inhibition_plexiglashole","percentage of correct choices in the plexiglas hole task - a correct choice is coded when individuals do not try to reach toward a food reward directly through a plexiglas panel and instead take a detour movement through one hole in the panel"
"inhibition_swingdoor","percentage of correct choices in the swing door task - a correct choice is coded when individuals do not try to reach toward a food reward directly through the baited plexiglas door and instead take a detour movement through the other non-baited door"
"inhibition_delayofgratification","indifference point (in seconds) in the delay of gratification task - time that individuals are willing to wait to receive a larger delayed food reward instead of a smaller immediate food reward"
"memory_30sec","percentage of correct choices in the 30-second memory task - a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward from under one of three opaque cups after 30 seconds"
"memory_30min","percentage of correct choices in the 30-minute memory task - a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward from under one of three opaque cups after 30 minutes"
"transposition1","percentage of correct choices in the transposition task (condition 1) -  a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward under one of three opaque cups- after the baited cup has switched location with another cup- while the third cup remains stationary"
"transposition2","percentage of correct choices in the transposition task (condition 2) -  a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward under one of three opaque cups, after the baited cup has switched location with another cup- and then again with the third cup"
"transposition3","percentage of correct choices in the transposition task (condition 3) -  a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward under one of three opaque cups, after the baited cup has switched location with another cup twice- returning to its original location"
"transposition4","percentage of correct choices in the transposition task (condition 4) -  a correct choice is coded when individuals retrieve a food reward under one of three opaque cups- after the unbaited cups have switched location- while the baited cup remains stationary"
"support1_cloth","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 1) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the cloth piece with a food reward on top instead of the cloth piece with a food reward close by"
"support2_cloth","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 2) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the large cloth piece with a food reward on top instead of a combination of two small cloth pieces- the accessible of which has no food reward on top"
"support3_cloth","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 3) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the cloth piece with a food reward on top of the cloth under a small bridge instead of the cloth piece with a food reward on top of the small bridge"
"support4_strings","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 4) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the long string with a food reward on top instead of a combination of two short strings divided by a gap- the accessible of which has no reward on top"
"support5_strings","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 5) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the long string with a food reward on top instead of a combination of two short strings being slightly overlapping- the accessible of which has no reward on top"
"support6_strings","percentage of correct choices in the support task (condition 6) - selecting between two cloth pieces and pulling the long string with a food reward on top instead of a combination of two short adjacent strings- the accessible of which has no reward on top"
