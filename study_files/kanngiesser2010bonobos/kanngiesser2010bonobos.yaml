abstract: Animals commonly use feature and spatial strategies when remembering places
  of interest such as food sources or hiding places. We conducted three experiments
  with great apes to investigate strategy preferences and factors that may shape them.
  In the Wrst experiment, we trained 17 apes to remember 12 diVerent food locations
  on the Xoor of their sleeping room. The 12 food locations were associated with one
  feature cue, so that feature and spatial cues were confounded. In a single test
  session, we brought the cues into conXict and found that apes, irrespective of species,
  showed a preference for a feature strategy. In the second experiment, we used a
  similar procedure and trained 25 apes to remember one food location on a platform
  in front of them. On average, apes preferred to use a feature strategy but some
  individuals relied on a spatial strategy. In the Wnal experiment, we investigated
  whether training might inXuence strategy preferences. We tested 21 apes in the platform
  set-up and found that apes used both, feature and spatial strategies irrespective
  of training. We conclude that apes can use feature and spatial strategies to remember
  the location of hidden food items, but that task demands (e.g. diVerent numbers
  of search locations) can influence strategy preferences. We found no evidence, however,
  for the role of training in shaping these preferences.
