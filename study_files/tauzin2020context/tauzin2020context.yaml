abstract: Great apes are able to request objects from humans by pointing. It is unclear,
  however, whether this is an associated response to a certain set of cues (e.g. the
  presence and attention of a human addressee) or a communicative signal which can
  be adjusted to relevant aspects of the spatial and social context. In three experiments,
  we tested captive great apes' flexible use of pointing gestures. We manipulated
  the communicative context so that the default pointing response of apes would have
  indicated an undesired object, either due to 1) the spatial arrangements of the
  target objects, 2) the perspective of the addressee or 3) the knowledge of the addressee
  about the target objects' location. The results of the three experiments indicate
  that great apes can successfully adjust their pointing to the spatial configuration
  of the referent environment such as distance and location of food. However, we found
  no evidence that they take the perspective or the knowledge of the addressee into
  account when doing so. This implies that pointing in great apes is a context-sensitive,
  but maybe less versatile, communicative signal compared to human pointing.
