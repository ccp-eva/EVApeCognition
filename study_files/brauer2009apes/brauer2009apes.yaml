abstract: Recent studies have produced mixed evidence about inequity aversion in nonhuman
  primates. Brosnan et al. [Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B.
  Biological Sciences 272:253–258, 2005] found inequity aversion in chimpanzees and
  argued that effort is crucial, if subjects are to evaluate how they are rewarded
  in comparison to a competitor for an identical performance. In this study we investigated
  inequity aversion with chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans, using the method of
  Brosnan et al. [Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B. Biological
  Sciences 272:253–258, 2005] after introducing some methodological improvements.
  Subjects always received a less-preferred food in exchange for a token, whereas
  the competitor received either the same type of food for their token (equity) or
  a more favored food for it (inequity). Apes did not refuse more of the less-preferred
  food when a competitor had received the more favored food. Thus, with an improved
  methodology we failed to reproduce the findings of Brosnan et al. [Proceedings of
  the Royal Society of London. Series B. Biological Sciences 272:253–258, 2005] that
  apes show inequity aversion. Am. J. Primatol. 71:175–181, 2009
