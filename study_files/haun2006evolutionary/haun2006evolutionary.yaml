abstract: Comparatively little is known about the inheritedprimate background underlying
  human cognition, the human cognitive ‘‘wildtype.’’ Yet it is possible to trace the
  evolution of human cognitive abilities and tendencies by contrasting the skills
  of our nearest cousins, not just chimpanzees, but all the extant great apes, thus
  showing what we are likely to have inherited from the common ancestor [1]. By looking
  at human infants early in cognitive development, we can also obtain insights into
  native cognitive biases in our species [2]. Here, we focus on spatial memory, a
  central cognitive domain. We show, first, that all nonhuman great apes and 1-year-old
  human infants exhibit a preference for place over feature strategies for spatial
  memory. This suggests the common ancestor of all great apes had the same preference.
  We then examine 3-year-old human children and find that this preference reverses.
  Thus, the continuity between our species and the other great apes is masked early
  in human ontogeny. These findings, based on both phylogenetic and ontogenetic contrasts,
  open up the prospect of a systematic evolutionary psychology resting upon the cladistics
  of cognitive preferences.
