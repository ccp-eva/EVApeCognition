abstract: Prosociality can be defined as any behaviour performed to alleviate the
  needs of others or to improve their welfare. Prosociality has probably played an
  essential role in the evolution of cooperative behaviour and sev eral studies have
  already investigated it in primates to understand the evolutionary origins of human
  prosociality. Two main tasks have been used to test prosociality in a food context.
  In the Platforms task, subjects can prosocially provide food to a partner by selecting
  a prosocial platform over a selfish one. In the Tokens task, subjects can prosocially
  provide food to a partner by selecting a prosocial token over a selfish one. As
  these tasks have provided mixed results, we used both tasks to test prosoci ality
  in great apes, capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys. Our results provided no compelling
  evidence of prosociality in a food context in any of the species tested. Additionally,
  our study revealed serious limitations of the Tokens task as it has been previously
  used. These results highlight the importance of controlling for confounding variables
  and of using multiple tasks to address inconsistencies present in the literature
