abstract: Because the faces and eyes of primates convey a rich array of social information,
  the way in which primates view faces and eyes reflects species-specific strategies
  for facial communication. How are humans and closely related species such as great
  apes similar and different in their viewing patterns for faces and eyes? Following
  previous studies comparing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with humans (Homo sapiens),
  this study used the eye-tracking method to directly compare the patterns of face
  and eye scanning by humans, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii).
  Human and ape participants freely viewed pictures of whole bodies and full faces
  of conspecifics and allospecifics under the same experimental conditions. All species
  were strikingly similar in that they viewed predominantly faces and eyes. No particular
  difference was identified between gorillas and orangutans, and they also did not
  differ from the chimpanzees tested in previous studies. However, humans were somewhat
  different from apes, especially with respect to prolonged eye viewing. We also examined
  how species-specific facial morphologies, such as the male flange of orangutans
  and the black-white contrast of human eyes, affected viewing patterns. Whereas the
  male flange of orangutans affected viewing patterns, the color contrast of human
  eyes did not. Humans showed prolonged eye viewing independently of the eye color
  of presented faces, indicating that this pattern is internally driven rather than
  stimulus dependent. Overall, the results show general similarities among the species
  and also identify unique eye-viewing patterns in humans.
