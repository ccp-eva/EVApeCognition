abstract: Contagious yawning is a form of response facilitation found in humans and
  other primates in which observing a model yawning enhances the chance that the observer
  will also yawn. Because contagious yawning seems to be more easily triggered when
  models are conspecifics or have a strong social bond with the observer, it has been
  proposed that contagious yawning is linked to empathy. A possible way to test this
  hypothesis is to analyze whether individuals’ responses differ when they observe
  models yawning or performing different involuntary (i.e., nose wiping, scratching)
  and voluntary (i.e., hand closing, wrist shaking) actions that are not linked to
  empathy. In this study, we tested the four great ape species with two different
  setups by exposing them to a human experimenter repeatedly performing these actions
  online, and video-recorded conspecifics repeatedly performing these actions on a
  screen. We examined which behaviors were subject to response facilitation, whether
  response facilitation was triggered by both human models and video recorded conspecifics,
  and whether all species showed evidence of response facilitation. Our results showed
  that chimpanzees yawned significantly more when and shortly after watching videos
  of conspecifics (but not humans) yawning than in control conditions, and they did
  not do so as a response to increased levels of anxiety. For all other behaviors,
  no species produced more target actions when being exposed to either model than
  under control conditions. Moreover, the individuals that were more ‘‘reactive’’
  when watching yawning videos were not more reactive when exposed to other actions.
  Since, at least in chimpanzees, (1) subjects only showed response facilitation when
  they were exposed to yawning and (2) only if models were conspecifics, it appears
  that contagious yawning is triggered by unique mechanisms and might be linked to
  empathy.
