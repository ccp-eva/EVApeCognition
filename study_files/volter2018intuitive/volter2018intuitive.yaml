abstract: There is ongoing debate about the extent to which nonhuman animals, like
  humans, can go beyond first-order perceptual information to abstract structural
  information from their environment. To provide more empirical evidence regarding
  this question, we examined what type of information great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos,
  and orangutans) gain from optical effects such as shadows and mirror images. In
  an initial experiment, we investigated whether apes would use mirror images and
  shadows to locate hidden food. We found that all examined ape species used these
  cues to find the food. Follow-up experiments showed that apes neither confused these
  optical effects with the food rewards nor did they merely associate cues with food.
  First, naïve chimpanzees used the shadow of the hidden food to locate it but they
  did not learn within the same number of trials to use a perceptually similar rubber
  patch as indicator of the hidden food reward. Second, apes made use of the mirror
  images to estimate the distance of the hidden food from their own body. Depending
  on the distance, apes either pointed into the direction of the food or tried to
  access the hidden food directly. Third, apes showed some sensitivity to the geometrical
  relation between mirror orientation and mirrored objects when searching hidden food.
  Fourth, apes tended to interpret mirror images and pictures of these mirror images
  differently depending on their prior knowledge. Together, these findings suggest
  that apes are sensitive to the optical relation between mirror images and shadows
  and their physical referents.
