  (2021). Chimpanzees’ (Pan troglodytes) internal arousal remains elevated if they
  cannot themselves help a conspecific. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 135(2),
  196-207. doi:10.1037/com0000255.
abstract: Chimpanzees help conspecifics achieve their goals in instrumental situations,
  but neither their immediate motivation nor the evolutionary basis of their motivation
  is clear. In the current study, we gave chimpanzees the opportunity to instrumentally
  help a conspecific to obtain food. Following recent studies with human children,
  we measured their pupil diameter at various points in the process. Like young children,
  chimpanzees’ pupil diameter decreased soon after they had helped. However, unlike
  children, chimpanzees’ pupils remained more dilated upon watching a third party
  provide the needed help instead of them. Our interpretation is that chimpanzees
  are motivated to help others, and the evolutionary basis is direct or indirect reciprocity,
  as providing help oneself sets the conditions for a payback. This is in contrast
  to young children whose goal is to see others being helped—by whomever—presumably
  because their helping is not based on reciprocity.
