abstract: Recently, Mendes et al. [1] described the use of a liquid tool (water) in
  captive orangutans. Here, we tested chimpanzees and gorillas for the first time
  with the same ‘‘floating peanut task.’’ None of the subjects solved the task. In
  order to better understand the cognitive demands of the task, we further tested
  other populations of chimpanzees and orangutans with the variation of the peanut
  initially floating or not. Twenty percent of the chimpanzees but none of the orangutans
  were successful. Additional controls revealed that successful subjects added water
  only if it was necessary to obtain the nut. Another experiment was conducted to
  investigate the reason for the differences in performance between the unsuccessful
  (Experiment 1) and the successful (Experiment 2) chimpanzee populations. We found
  suggestive evidence for the view that functional fixedness might have impaired the
  chimpanzees’ strategies in the first experiment. Finally, we tested how human children
  of different age classes perform in an analogous experimental setting. Within the
  oldest group (8 years), 58 percent of the children solved the problem, whereas in
  the youngest group (4 years), only 8 percent were able to find the solution
