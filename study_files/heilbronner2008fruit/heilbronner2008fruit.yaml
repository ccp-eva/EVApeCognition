abstract: 'Human and non-human animals tend to avoid risky prospects. If such patterns
  of economic choice are adaptive, risk preferences should reflect the typical decision-making
  environments faced by organisms. However, this approach has not been widely used
  to examine the risk sensitivity in closely related species with different ecologies.
  Here, we experimentally examined risk-sensitive behaviour in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
  and bonobos (Pan paniscus), closely related species whose distinct ecologies are
  thought to be the major selective force shaping their unique behavioural repertoires.
  Because chimpanzees exploit riskier food sources in the wild, we predicted that
  they would exhibit greater tolerance for risk in choices about food. Results confirmed
  this prediction: chimpanzees significantly preferred the risky option, whereas bonobos
  preferred the fixed option. These results provide a relatively rare example of risk-prone
  behaviour in the context of gains and show how ecological pressures can sculpt economic
  decision making.'
