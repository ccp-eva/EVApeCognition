abstract: Inductive learning from limited observations is a cognitive capacity of
  fundamental importance. In humans, it is underwritten by our intuitive statistics,
  the ability to draw systematic inferences from populations to randomly drawn samples
  and vice versa. According to recent research in cognitive development, human intuitive
  statistics develops early in infancy. Recent work in comparative psychology has
  produced first evidence for analogous cognitive capacities in great apes who flexibly
  drew inferences from populations to samples. In the present study, we investigated
  whether great apes (Pongo abelii, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla)
  also draw inductive inferences in the opposite direction, from samples to populations.
  In two experiments, apes saw an experimenter randomly drawing one multi-item sample
  from each of two populations of food items. The populations differed in their proportion
  of preferred to neutral items (24:6 vs. 6:24) but apes saw only the distribution
  of food items in the samples that reflected the distribution of the respective populations
  (e.g., 4:1 vs. 1:4). Based on this observation they were then allowed to choose
  between the two populations. Results show that apes seemed to make inferences from
  samples to populations and thus chose the population from which the more favorable
  (4:1) sample was drawn in Experiment 1. In this experiment, the more attractive
  sample not only contained proportionally but also absolutely more preferred food
  items than the less attractive sample. Experiment 2, however, revealed that when
  absolute and relative frequencies were disentangled, apes performed at chance level.
  Whether these limitations in apes’ performance reflect true limits of cognitive
  competence or merely performance limitations due to accessory task demands is still
  an open question.
