abstract: This study investigated whether physical discreteness helps apes to understand
  the concept of Piagetian conservation (i.e. the invariance of quantities). Subjects
  were four bonobos, three chimpanzees, and five orangutans. Apes were tested on their
  ability to conserve discrete/continuous quantities in an over-conservation procedure
  in which two unequal quantities of edible rewards underwent various transformations
  in front of subjects. Subjects were examined to determine whether they could track
  the larger quantity of reward after the transformation. Comparison between the two
  types of conservation revealed that tests with bonobos supported the discreteness
  hypothesis. Bonobos, but neither chimpanzees nor orangutans, performed significantly
  better with discrete quantities than with continuous ones. The results suggest that
  at least bonobos could benefit from the discreteness of stimuli in their acquisition
  of conservation skills.
