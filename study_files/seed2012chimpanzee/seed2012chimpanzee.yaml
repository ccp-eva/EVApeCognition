abstract: Differences between individuals are the raw material from which theories
  of the evolution and ontogeny of cognition are built. For example, when 4-year-old
  children pass a test requiring them to communicate the content of another's falsely
  held belief, while 3-year-olds fail, we know that something must change over the
  course of the third year of life. In the search for what develops or evolves, the
  typical route is to probe the extents and limits of successful individuals' ability.
  Another is to focus on those that failed, and find out what difference or lack prevented
  them from passing the task. Recent research in developmental psychology has harnessed
  individual differences to illuminate the cognitive mechanisms that emerge to enable
  success. We apply this approach to explaining some of the failures made by chimpanzees
  when using tools to solve problems. Twelve of 16 chimpanzees failed to discriminate
  between a complete and a broken tool when, after being set down, the ends of the
  broken one were aligned in front of them. There was a correlation between performance
  on this aligned task and another in which after being set down, the centre of both
  tools was covered, suggesting that the limiting factor was not the representation
  of connection, but memory or attention. Some chimpanzees that passed the aligned
  task passed a task in which the location of the broken tool was never visible but
  had to be inferred.
