abstract: Among the visual preferences that guide many everyday activities and decisions,
  from consumer choices to social judgment, preference for curved over sharp-angled
  contours is commonly thought to have played an adaptive role throughout human evolution,
  favoring the avoidance of potentially harmful objects. However, because nonhuman
  primates also exhibit preferences for certain visual qualities, it is conceivable
  that humans' preference for curved contours is grounded on perceptual and cognitive
  mechanisms shared with extant nonhuman primate species. Here we aimed to determine
  whether nonhuman great apes and humans share a visual preference for curved over
  sharp-angled contours using a 2-alternative forced choice experimental paradigm
  under comparable conditions. Our results revealed that the human group and the great
  ape group indeed share a common preference for curved over sharp-angled contours,
  but that they differ in the manner and magnitude with which this preference is expressed
  behaviorally. These results suggest that humans' visual preference for curved objects
  evolved from earlier primate species' visual preferences, and that during this process
  it became stronger, but also more susceptible to the influence of higher cognitive
  processes and preference for other visual features.
