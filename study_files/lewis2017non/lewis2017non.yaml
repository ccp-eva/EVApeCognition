abstract: 'We examined if apes spontaneously remember one-time, distinctive events
  across long delays when probed by discriminant cues. Apes witnessed an experimenter
  hide a cache of food, which they could then retrieve. They retrieved one of two
  food types; one more distinctive than the other. Two, 10 or 50 weeks later, the
  apes returned to the same enclosure and found a piece of the previously hidden food
  on the ground. An experimenter who had not hidden the food was also present. Apes
  immediately searched the location where the food was previously hidden (no food
  was here), showing recall of the event. One week later, apes returned to the same
  enclosure, with the same food on the ground, but now the experimenter that had hidden
  the food was present. Again, apes immediately searched the hiding location. Apes
  that had not witnessed the hiding event did not search. There was no significant
  effect of food type, and retention declined from exposure to the two-week delay,
  then levelled, consistent with the forgetting curve in humans (Ebbinghaus, H. 1964
  Memory: a contribution to experimental psychology (transl. H.A. Ruger & C.E. Bussenvis).
  New York, NY: Dover. (Original work published 1885.)). This is the first study to
  show apes can recall a one-time, non-goal-directed event longer than two weeks ago
  and that apes'' recall declines in accordance with a standard retention function.'
