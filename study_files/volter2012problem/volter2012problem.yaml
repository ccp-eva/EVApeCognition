abstract: What kind of information animals use when solving problems is a controversial
  topic. Previous research suggests that, in some situations, great apes prefer to
  use causally relevant cues over arbitrary ones. To further examine to what extent
  great apes are able to use information about causal relations, we presented three
  different puzzle box problems to the four nonhuman great ape species. Of primary
  interest here was a comparison between one group of apes that received visual access
  to the functional mechanisms of the puzzle boxes and one group that did not. Apes’
  performance in the first two, less complex puzzle boxes revealed that they are able
  to solve such problems by means of trial-and-error learning, requiring no information
  about the causal structure of the problem. However, visual inspection of the functional
  mechanisms of the puzzle boxes reduced the amount of time needed to solve the problems.
  In the case of the most complex problem, which required the use of a crank, visual
  feedback about what happened when the handle of the crank was turned was necessary
  for the apes to solve the task. Once the solution was acquired, however, visual
  feedback was no longer required. We conclude that visual feedback about the consequences
  of their actions helps great apes to solve complex problems. As the crank task matches
  the basic requirements of vertical string pulling in birds, the present results
  are discussed in light of recent findings with corvids.
