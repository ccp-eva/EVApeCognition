abstract: We examined whether eight capuchins and eight chimpanzees were able to retrieve
  a reward placed inside a tube, of varying length, by selecting the correct stick
  from different sets of three sticks differing in length (functional feature) and
  handle (non-functional feature). Moreover, to investigate whether seeing the stick
  inside the tube (visual feedback) improves performance, half of the subjects were
  tested with a transparent apparatus and the other half with an opaque apparatus.
  Phase 1 included (a) Training 1 in which each stick had a different handle and (b)
  Transfer 1 in which the handles were switched among sticks, so that the functional
  tool had the same length but a different handle than before. The seven chimpanzees
  and one capuchin that passed Transfer 1 received Transfer 2. The other subjects
  received (a) Training 2, which used the same sticks from Phase 1 with handles switched
  in every trial, and (b) Transfer 2 in which the tube was longer, all sticks had
  the same new handle, and the formerly longest tool became intermediate in length.
  Eight chimpanzees and three capuchins passed Transfer 2. Results showed that (1)
  chimpanzees applied relational structures in tool using tasks more quickly than
  capuchins and (2) capuchins required more varied experience to attend to the functional
  feature of the tool. Interestingly, visual feedback did not improve performance
  in either species.
