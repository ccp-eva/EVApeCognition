abstract: 'Chimpanzees and bonobos are highly capable of tracking other’s mental states.
  It has been proposed, however, that in contrast to humans, chimpanzees are only
  able to do this in competitive interactions but this has rarely been directly tested.
  Here, pairs of chimpanzees or bonobos (Study 1) and 4-yearold children (Study 2)
  were presented with two almost identical tasks differing only regarding the social
  context. In the cooperation condition, players’ interests were matched: they had
  to make corresponding choices to be mutually rewarded. To facilitate coordination,
  subjects should thus make their actions visible to their partner whose view was
  partially occluded. In the competition condition, players’ interests were directly
  opposed: the partner tried to match the subject’s choice but subjects were only
  rewarded if they chose differently, so that they benefited from hiding their actions.
  The apes successfully adapted their decisions to the social context and their performance
  was markedly better in the cooperation condition. Children also distinguished between
  the two contexts, but somewhat surprisingly, performed better in the competitive
  condition. These findings demonstrate experimentally that chimpanzees and bonobos
  can take into account what others can see in cooperative interactions. Their social-cognitive
  skills are thus more flexible than previously assumed.'
