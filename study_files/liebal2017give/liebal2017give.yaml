abstract: Proximate factors of primate food sharing, in contrast to its evolutionary
  explanations, have received little attention. Active food sharing is considered
  prosocial, since possessors may benefit others by spontaneously passing food or
  by reacting to ‘signals of need’. However, in contrast to passive sharing, active
  food sharing is rare in most nonhuman primates. Surprisingly, previous research
  showed that captive Sumatran orang-utans actively share food more frequently than
  chimpanzees and bonobos, and hence, appear more prosocial. Yet these comparisons
  with the two Pan species were relying on previously published studies, which differed
  with regard to methods and food types used. Here we used the identical procedure
  and food type to compare the food-sharing behaviour of 10 captive Sumatran orang-utans
  and 18 chimpanzees, in situations where individuals could monopolize a sharable
  food source. We focused on communicative behaviours used to initiate food transfers,
  and assessed whether and how much food was transferred in response to these initiation
  attempts. In both species, most transfers were initiated by taking the food, resulting
  in passive sharing, while active sharing by offering food or after requesting it
  occurred only rarely. However, orang-utans differed from chimpanzees in several
  aspects. Because the food was mostly monopolized by the adult male, orang-utans
  attempted to initiate food transfers more frequently, resisted more to taking attempts,
  and were less likely to transfer whole food items. In both species, requests were
  less likely to result in food transfers, indicating that in situations involving
  access to food, they do not necessarily respond to ‘signals of need’. We argue that
  in addition to instances of active sharing, other factors such as the degree of
  food monopolization, response rates to ‘signals of need’, and the quality and quantity
  of transferred food need to be considered to gain a more detailed picture of prosociality
  across species.
