abstract: 'Apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, P. troglodytes, Pong abelii) and corvids
  (Corvus corax, C. corone) are among the most proficient and flexible tool users
  in the animal kingdom. Although it has been proposed that this is the result of
  convergent evolution, little is known about whether this is limited to behavior
  or also includes the underlying cognitive mechanisms. We compared several species
  of apes (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) and corvids (carrion crows
  and common ravens) using exactly the same paradigm: a support task with elements
  from the classical patterned-string tasks. Corvids proved able to solve at least
  an easy pattern, whereas apes outperformed corvids with respect to the complexity
  of the patterns solved, the relative number of subjects solving each problem, and
  the speed to reach criterion. We addressed the question of whether subjects based
  their choices purely on perceptual cues or on a more abstract understanding of the
  problem. This was done by using a perceptually very similar but causally different
  condition where instead of paper strips there were strip shapes painted on a platform.
  Corvidsâ€™ performance did not differ between conditions, whereas apes were able to
  solve the real but not the painted task. This shows that apes were not basing their
  choices just on spatial or arbitrary perceptual cues. Instead, and unlike corvids,
  they must have had some causal knowledge of the task.'
