  Nasal temperature drop in response to a playback of conspecific fights in chimpanzees:
  A thermo-imaging study. Physiology & Behavior, 155, 83-94. doi:10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.11.029.'
abstract: 'Emotion is one of the central topics in animal studies and is likely to
  attract attention substantially in the coming years. Recent studies have developed
  a thermo-imaging technique to measure the facial skin temperature in the studies
  of emotion in humans and macaques. Here we established the procedures and techniques
  needed to apply the same technique to great apes. We conducted two experiments respectively
  in the two established research facilities in Germany and Japan. Total twelve chimpanzees
  were tested in three conditions in which they were presented respectively with the
  playback sounds (Exp. 1) or the videos (Exp. 2) of fighting conspecifics, control
  sounds/videos (allospecific display call: Exp. 1; resting conspecifics: Exp. 2),
  and no sound/image. Behavioral, hormonal (salivary cortisol) and heart-rate responses
  were simultaneously recorded. The nasal temperature of chimpanzees linearly dropped
  up to 1.5 °C in 2 min, and recovered to the baseline in 2 min, in the experimental
  but not control conditions. We found the related changes in excitement behavior
  and heart-rate variability, but not in salivary cortisol, indicating that overall
  responses were involved with the activities of sympathetic nervous system but not
  with the measureable activities of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
  The influence of general activity (walking, eating) was not negligible but controllable
  in experiments. We propose several techniques to control those confounding factors.
  Overall, thermo-imaging is a promising technique that should be added to the traditional
  physiological and behavioral measures in primatology and comparative psychology.'
