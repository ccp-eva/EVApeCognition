abstract: 'Nut-cracking with hammer tools (henceforth: nut-cracking) has been argued
  to be one of the most complex tool-use behaviors observed in nonhuman animals. So
  far, only chimpanzees, capuchins, and macaques have been observed using tools to
  crack nuts in the wild (Boesch and Boesch, 1990; Gumert et al., 2009; Mannu and
  Ottoni, 2009). However, the learning mechanisms behind this behavior, and the extent
  of nut-cracking in other primate species are still unknown. The aim of this study
  was two-fold. First, we investigated whether another great ape species would develop
  nut-cracking when provided with all the tools and appropriate conditions to do so.
  Second, we examined the mechanisms behind the emergence of nut-cracking by testing
  a naive sample. Orangutans (Pongo abelii and Pongo pygmaeus) have the second most
  extensive tool-use repertoire among the great apes (after chimpanzees) and show
  flexible problem-solving capacities. Orangutans have not been observed cracking
  nuts in the wild, however, perhaps because their arboreal habits provide limited
  opportunities for nut-cracking. Therefore, orangutans are a valid candidate species
  for the investigation of the development of this behavior. Four nut-cracking- naive
  orangutans at Leipzig zoo (P. abelii; Mage = 16; age range = 10-19; 4F; at the time
  of testing) were provided with nuts and hammers but were not demonstrated the nut-cracking
  behavioral form. Additionally, we report data from a previously unpublished study
  by one of the authors (Martina Funk) with eight orangutans housed at Zürich zoo
  (six P. abelii and two P. pygmaeus; Mage = 14; age range = 2-30; 5F; at the time
  of testing) that followed a similar testing paradigm. Out of the twelve orangutans
  tested, at least four individuals, one from Leipzig (P. abelii) and three from Zürich
  (P. abelii and P. pygmaeus), spontaneously expressed nut-cracking using wooden hammers.
  These results demonstrate that nut-cracking can emerge in orangutans through individual
  learning and certain types of non-copying social learning.'
