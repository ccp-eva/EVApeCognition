  in great apes' communication about absent entities. Journal of Comparative Psychology,

abstract: Recent evidence suggests that great apes can use the former location of
  an entity to communicate about it. In this study we built on these findings to investigate
  the social– cognitive foundations of great apes’ communicative abilities. We tested
  whether great apes (n   35) would adjust their requests for absent entities to previous
  interactions they had with their interlocutor. We manipulated the apes’ experience
  with respect to the interlocutor’s knowledge about the previous content of the now-empty
  location as well as their experience with the interlocutor’s competence to provide
  additional food items. We found that apes adjusted their requests to both of these
  aspects but failed to integrate them with one another. These results demonstrate
  a surprising amount of flexibility in great apes’ communicative abilities while
  at the same time suggesting some important limitations in their social communicative
  skills.
