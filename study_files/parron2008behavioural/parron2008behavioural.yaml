abstract: 'This study assessed how pictorially naïve nonhuman primates understand
  pictures. Fifty-five baboons with no prior exposure to pictures were trained to
  grasp a slice of banana presented against a pebble in a two alternative forced choice
  task. Post-training testing involved three stimulus pairs: (1) real banana slice
  vs. its picture, (2) the banana picture vs. a real pebble and (3) banana picture
  vs. a pebble picture which were presented twice. Preliminary data were also collected
  on naïve gorillas (n=4) and chimpanzees (n=7) using the same procedure. Baboons
  revealed a preference for the food picture in (2) and (3) and often ate this stimulus,
  but the food item and its picture were accurately discriminated in (1). These results
  suggest that baboons mistook the pictorial stimulus and its referent, but processed
  the banana pictures as poor exemplars of the real banana category. Among apes, only
  gorillas ate the banana pictures, suggesting that picture-object confusion may also
  occur in this species. Findings are discussed as pertaining to the general issue
  of representational abilities in nonhuman primates, and its evolution.'
