abstract: To create social closeness, humans engage in a variety of social activities
  centered around shared experiences. Even simply watching the same video side by
  side creates social closeness in adults and children. However, perhaps surprisingly,
  a similar psychological mechanism was recently shown in great apes. Here we asked
  whether the process by which this social closeness is created is the same for children
  and great apes. Each participant entered a room to see an experimenter (E1) watching
  a video. In one condition, E1 looked to the participant at the start of the video
  to establish common ground that they were watching the video together. In another
  condition, E1 did not look to the participant in this way so that the participant
  knew they were watching the same video, but the participant did not know whether
  E1 was aware of this as well, so there was no common ground (E1 looked to the participant
  later in the procedure). Children, but not great apes, approached the experimenter
  faster after the common ground condition, suggesting that although both humans and
  great apes create social closeness by co-attending to something in close proximity,
  creating social closeness by sharing experiences in common ground may be a uniquely
  human social-cognitive process.
