abstract: Iconic gestures—communicative acts using hand or body move ments that resemble
  their referent—figure prominently in theories of language evolution and development.
  This study contrasted the abilities of chimpanzees (N = 11) and 4-year-old human
  children (N = 24) to comprehend novel iconic gestures. Participants learned to retrieve
  rewards from apparatuses in two distinct locations, each requiring a different action.
  In the test, a human adult informed the participant where to go by miming the action
  needed to obtain the reward. Children used the iconic gestures (more than arbitrary
  gestures) to locate the reward, whereas chimpanzees did not. Some children also
  used arbitrary gestures in the same way, but only after they had previously shown
  comprehension for iconic gestures. Over time, chimpanzees learned to associate iconic
  gestures with the appropriate location faster than arbitrary gestures, suggesting
  at least some recognition of the iconicity involved. These results demonstrate the
  importance of iconicity in referential communication
