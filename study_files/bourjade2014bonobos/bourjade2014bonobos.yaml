  and orangutans, but not chimpanzees, flexibly plan for the future in a token-exchange

abstract: Non-human animals, including great apes, have been suggested to share some
  of the skills for planning that humans commonly exhibit. A crucial difference between
  human and non-human planning may relate to the diversity of domains and needs in
  which this skill is expressed. Although great apes can save tools for future use,
  there is little evidence yet that they can also do so in other contexts. To investigate
  this question further, we presented the apes with a planning token-exchange task
  that differed from standard tool-use tasks. Additionally, we manipulated the future
  outcome of the task to investigate planning flexibility. In the Exchange condition,
  subjects had to collect, save and transport tokens because they would need them
  30 min later to exchange them for food with a human, i.e., ‘‘bring-back’’ response.
  In the Release condition, the collection and transport of tokens were not needed
  as no exchange took place after 30 min. Out of 13 subjects, eight solved the task
  at least once in the Exchange condition, with chimpanzees appearing less successful
  than the other species. Importantly, three individuals showed a clear differential
  response between conditions by producing more ‘‘bring-back’’ responses in the Exchange
  than in the Release conditions. Those bonobo and orangutan individuals hence adapted
  their planning behavior according to changing needs (i.e., they brought tokens back
  significantly more often when they would need them). Bonobos and orangutans, unlike
  chimpanzees, planned outside the context of tool-use, thus challenging the idea
  that planning in these species is purely domain-specific.
