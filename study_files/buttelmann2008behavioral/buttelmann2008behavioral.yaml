abstract: We conducted three studies to examine whether the four great ape species
  (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are able to use behavioral experimenter-given
  cues in an object-choice task. In the subsequent experimental conditions subjects
  were presented with two eggs, one of which contained food and the other did not.
  In Study 1 the experimenter examined both eggs by smelling or shaking them, but
  only made a failed attempt to open (via biting) the egg containing food. In a control
  condition, the experimenter examined and attempted to open both eggs, but in reverse
  order to control for stimulus enhancement. The apes significantly preferred the
  egg that was first examined and then bitten, but had no preference in a baseline
  condition in which there were no cues. In Study 2, we investigated whether the apes
  could extend this ability to cues not observed in apes so far (i.e., attempting
  to pull apart the egg), as well as whether they made this discrimination based on
  the function of the action the experimenter performed. Subjects significantly preferred
  eggs presented with this novel cue, but did not prefer eggs presented with a novel
  but functionally irrelevant action. In Study 3, apes did not interpret human actions
  as cues to food-location when they already knew that the eggs were empty. Thus,
  great apes were able to use a variety of experimenter-given cues associated with
  foraging actions to locate hidden food and thereby were partially sensitive to the
  general purpose underlying these actions.
