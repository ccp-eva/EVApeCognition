abstract: Orang-utans played a communication game in two studies testing their ability
  to produce and comprehend requestive pointing. While the 'communicator' could see
  but not obtain hidden food, the 'donor' could release the food to the communicator,
  but could not see its location for herself. They could coordinate successfully if
  the communicator pointed to the food, and if the donor comprehended his communicative
  goal and responded pro-socially. In Study 1, one orang-utan pointed regularly and
  accurately for peers. However, they responded only rarely. In Study 2, a human experimenter
  played the communicator's role in three conditions, testing the apes' comprehension
  of points of different heights and different degrees of ostension. There was no
  effect of condition. However, across conditions one donor performed well individually,
  and as a group orang-utans' comprehension performance tended towards significance.
  We explain this on the grounds that comprehension required inferences that they
  found difficult - but not impossible. The finding has valuable implications for
  our thinking about the development of pointing in phylogeny.
