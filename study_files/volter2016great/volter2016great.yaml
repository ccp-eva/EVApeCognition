abstract: We investigated whether nonhuman great apes (N = 23), 2.5-year-old (N =
  20), and 3-year-old children (N = 40) infer causal relations from patterns of variation
  and covariation by adapting the blicket detector paradigm for apes. We presented
  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), orangutans (Pongo abelii),
  gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and children (Homo sapiens) with a novel reward dispenser,
  the blicket detector. The detector was activated by inserting specific (yet randomly
  determined) objects, the so-called blickets. Once activated a reward was released,
  accompanied by lights and a short tone. Participants were shown different patterns
  of variation and covariation between two different objects and the activation of
  the detector. When subsequently choosing between one of the two objects to activate
  the detector on their own all species, except gorillas (who failed the training),
  took these patterns of correlation into account. In particular, apes and 2.5-year-old
  children ignored objects whose effect on the detector completely depended on the
  presence of another object. Follow-up experiments explored whether the apes and
  children were also able to re-evaluate evidence retrospectively. Only children (3-year-olds
  in particular) were able to make such retrospective inferences about causal structures
  from observing the effects of the experimenter’s actions. Apes succeeded here only
  when they observed the effects of their own interventions. Together, this study
  provides evidence that apes, like young children, accurately infer causal structures
  from patterns of (co)variation and that they use this information to inform their
  own interventions.
