abstract: 'Chimpanzees and humans establish preferences over individuals they may
  benefit more from through scoring indirect reputation. However, humans prefer prosocial
  individuals even at their own cost. Giving preference to prosocial reputation over
  material rewards might have permitted the establishment of cooperative human societies.
  We tested the evolutionary roots of this propensity: importantly, in our study,
  the reputation scored had no food involved. Eighteen chimpanzees watched a performance
  where an antisocial experimenter hit a human victim and a prosocial experimenter
  interrupted the fight and consoled the victim. Next, the chimpanzees begged food
  from one of them. In Phase 2, the experimenters offered different food amounts (antisocial
  + 4 vs. prosocial + 1). Chimpanzees significantly prioritized rewards over reputation
  (i.e., chose antisocial). In Phase 3, both experimenters offered two pieces of food.
  Most of the subjects showed indifference to reputation (i.e., chose randomly). Watching
  fights produced significantly more arousal than consolations. Emotional engagement
  could not account for chimpanzees’ choices since their choices varied between phases
  but their arousal did not. Ontogeny and rearing history might play a role in chimpanzees’
  choices: the adolescent males (n = 3) consistently chose the antisocial individual
  whereas hand-reared subjects chose significantly different from mother-reared. We
  discuss whether the valence of the reputation is species-specific.'
