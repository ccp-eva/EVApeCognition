abstract: Wild chimpanzees select tools according to their rigidity. However, little
  is known about whether choices are solely based on familiarity with the materials
  or knowledge about tool properties. Furthermore, it is unclear whether tool manipulation
  is required prior to selection or whether observation alone can suffice. We investigated
  whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (n = 9), bonobos (Pan paniscus) (n = 4), orangutans
  (Pongo pygmaeus) (n = 6), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) (n = 2) selected new tools
  on the basis of their rigidity. Subjects faced an out-of-reach reward and a choice
  of three tools differing in color, diameter, material, and rigidity. We used 10
  different 3-tool sets (1 rigid, 2 flexible). Subjects were unfamiliar with the tools
  and needed to select and use the rigid tool to retrieve the reward. Experiment 1
  showed that subjects chose the rigid tool from the first trial with a 90% success
  rate. Experiments 2a and 2b addressed the role of manipulation and observation in
  tool selection. Subjects performed equally well in conditions in which they could
  manipulate the tools themselves or saw the experimenter manipulate the tools but
  decreased their performance if they could only visually inspect the tools. Experiment
  3 showed that subjects could select flexible tools (as opposed to rigid ones) to
  meet new task demands. We conclude that great apes spontaneously selected unfamiliar
  rigid or flexible tools even after gathering minimal observational information.
