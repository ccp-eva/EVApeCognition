abstract: Evidence suggests that great apes engage in metacognitive information seeking
  for food items. To support the claim that a domain-general cognitive process underlies
  ape metacognition one needs to show that selective information seeking extends to
  non-food items. In this study, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo
  abelii) either had to determine the location of a desired food item or a property
  of a non-food item (length of a tool). We manipulated whether subjects received
  prior information about the item’s location or property. During the test, subjects
  had the opportunity to seek the respective information. Results show that apes engaged
  in more information seeking when they had no prior knowledge. Importantly, this
  selective pattern of information seeking applied to food as well as to tools.
