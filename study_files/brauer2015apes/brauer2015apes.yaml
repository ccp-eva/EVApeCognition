abstract: There is now growing evidence that some animal species are able to plan
  for the future. For example great apes save and exchange tools for future use. Here
  we raise the question whether chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos would produce
  tools for future use. Subjects only had access to a baited apparatus for a limited
  duration and therefore should use the time preceding this access to create the appropriate
  tools in order to get the rewards. The apes were tested in three conditions depending
  on the need for pre-prepared tools. Either eight tools, one tool or no tools were
  needed to retrieve the reward. The apes prepared tools in advance for future use
  and they produced them mainly in conditions when they were really needed. The fact
  that apes were able to solve this new task indicates that their planning skills
  are flexible. However, for the condition in which eight tools were needed, apes
  produced less than two tools per trial in advance. However, they used their chance
  to produce additional tools in the tool use phase—thus often obtaining most of the
  reward from the apparatus. Increased pressure to prepare more tools in advance did
  not have an effect on their performance. Am. J. Primatol. 77:254–263, 2015.
