abstract: Directly comparing the prosocial behaviour of our two closest living relatives,
  bonobos and chimpanzees, is essential to deepening our understanding of the evolution
  of human prosociality. We examined whether helpers of six dyads of chimpanzees and
  bonobos transferred tools to a conspecific. In the experiment ‘Helping’, transferring
  a tool did not benefit the helper, while in the experiment ‘Cooperation’, the helper
  only obtained a reward by transferring the correct tool. Chimpanzees did not share
  tools with conspecifics in either experiment, except for a mother–daughter pair,
  where the mother shared a tool twice in the experiment ‘Helping’. By contrast, all
  female–female bonobo dyads sometimes transferred a tool even without benefit. When
  helpers received an incentive, we found consistent transfers in all female–female
  bonobo dyads but none in male–female dyads. Even though reaching by the bonobo receivers
  increased the likelihood that a transfer occurred, we found no significant species
  difference in whether receivers reached to obtain tools. Thus, receivers' behaviour
  did not explain the lack of transfers from chimpanzee helpers. This study supports
  the notion that bonobos might have a greater ability to understand social problems
  and the collaborative nature of such tasks.
