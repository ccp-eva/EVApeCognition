abstract: In both the wild and captivity, chimpanzees engage in reciprocal patterns
  of prosocial behavior. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying these patterns
  are unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether chimpanzees prefer to
  act prosocially toward conspecifics who have directly benefited them (perhaps based
  on an affective bond) or whether they simply observe the prosocial behavior of others
  in general (including indirectly to third parties) and preferentially interact with
  and behave prosocially toward the most prosocial individuals. We found good evidence
  for direct reciprocity but little evidence for a general (indirect) preference for
  prosocial individuals. These results suggest that cooperative reciprocity in chimpanzees
  may be based mostly on social-affective processes and direct interactions.
