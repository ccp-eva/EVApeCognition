abstract: In their natural habitats orangutans and gibbons have to solve spatial problems
  to find enough food, which is distributed over large areas and available at different
  times of the year. Therefore both species should evolve spatial memory skills to
  remember spatial locations and their content. We conducted 2 studies in a 1900-m2
  naturalistic outdoor enclosure. In the 1st study, we hid kiwi pieces in 10 different
  locations and placed kiwi pieces in a visible location. Individuals of both species
  approached significantly more food locations in the test condition than in the control
  condition in which no food was hidden. In the 2nd study, we hid 2 types of food
  in 10 different locations so that individuals had to remember which food type was
  where. We hid bananas on trees (banana condition) and grapes under bamboo shrubs
  (grape condition). We also placed oranges in full view (control condition) to rule
  out the possibility that finding food may automatically trigger an indiscriminate
  search. Individuals approached the banana locations more often in the banana than
  in the other 2 conditions. Some orangutans, but not the gibbon, also approached
  the grape locations more often in the grape than in the other 2 conditions. Individuals
  often returned to locations in which they previously found food and rarely revisited
  locations in the same session. We detected little influence of the food quantity
  and no influence of the distance to each location on the subjects' foraging behavior.
