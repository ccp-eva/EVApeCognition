abstract: Recent research suggests that great apes are less vulnerable to cohesion
  violations than human infants are. In contrast to human infants, apes successfully
  track nonsolid substances or split solid objects through occlusion (Cacchione &
  Call, 2010a; Cacchione, Hrubesch, & Call, 2012, 2013). The present study aims to
  investigate whether the lower vulnerability of great apes to cohesion violations
  also manifests when they are tracking collections. While even very young human infants
  appreciate the continuous existence of solid bound objects, they fail to show similar
  intuitions when tracking collections of objects (Chiang & Wynn, 2000). In a manual
  search task inspired by recent infant research, we tested whether humansâ€™ closest
  relatives, the great apes, showed a similar contrast in their reasoning about single
  solid objects and objects within collections. The results suggest that, in contrast
  to human infants, great apes appreciate the continuous existence of objects within
  collections and successfully track them through occlusion. This confirms the view
  that great apes are generally less vulnerable to cohesion violations than human
  infants
