abstract: Humans are able to benefit from a causally structured problem-solving context
  rather than arbitrarily structured situations. In order to better understand nonhuman
  causal cognition, it is therefore important to isolate crucial factors that might
  differentiate between events that follow a purely spatial and temporal contingency
  and those that hold a 'true' causal relationship. In the first of two experiments,
  chimpanzee subjects were required to detect a bottle containing juice from five
  opaque bottles of equal shape and size. In the causal condition, the juice bottle
  looked identical to the other four bottles, only it was much heavier than the others.
  In the arbitrary condition, the weight of all five bottles was identical, but the
  juice bottle was color-marked differently. Since bottle opening was made difficult
  (and therefore costly), the question was whether subject's manipulative behavior
  would be random or somehow influenced by the nature of the provided information.
  Our results show that subjects detected and opened the juice bottle significantly
  faster when weight was the discriminating feature (causal condition) compared to
  situations in which the discrimination was necessarily based on a color-cue (arbitrary
  condition). Experiment 2 ruled out the possibility of a general learning bias toward
  tactile rather than visual information in chimpanzees. When tested in a simple exchange
  paradigm that prevented any use of causal information, no predominance of a tactile
  cue (weight) over a visual cue (color) could be found. Furthermore—and in contrast
  to the causal condition in Experiment 1—no learning occurred during the course of
  Experiment 2, neither in the weight nor in the color condition. We therefore conclude
  that chimpanzees can more easily determine the content of an object based on its
  causal properties compared to situations in which the only available information
  is a pure arbitrary regularity. This supports the view that chimpanzees' causal
  cognition does not rely on mere perceptual information but also on structural abstraction
  about their physical environment.
