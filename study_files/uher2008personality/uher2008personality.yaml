abstract: 'Three methods of personality assessment (behavior measures, behavior ratings,
  adjective ratings) were compared in 20 zoo-housed Great Apes: bonobos (Pan paniscus),
  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and orangutans
  (Pongo pygmaeus abelii). To test a new bottom-up approach, the studied trait constructs
  were systematically generated from the species’ behavioral repertoires. The assessments
  were reliable, temporally stable, and showed substantial cross-method coherence.
  In most traits, behavior ratings mediated the relations between adjective ratings
  and behavior measures. Results suggest that high predictability of manifest behavior
  is best achieved by behavior ratings, not by adjectives. Empirical evidence for
  trait constructs beyond current personality models points to the necessity of broad
  and systematic approaches for valid inferences on a species’ personality structure.'
