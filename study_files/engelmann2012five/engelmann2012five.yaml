abstract: 'Virtually all theories of the evolution of cooperation require that cooperators
  find ways to interact with one another selectively, to the exclusion of cheaters.
  This means that individuals must make reputational judgments about others as cooperators,
  based on either direct or indirect evidence. Humans, and possibly other species,
  add another component to the process: they know that they are being judged by others,
  and so they adjust their behavior in order to affect those judgments – so-called
  impression management. Here, we show for the first time that already preschool children
  engage in such behavior. In an experimental study, 5-year-old human children share
  more and steal less when they are being watched by a peer than when they are alone.
  In contrast, chimpanzees behave the same whether they are being watched by a groupmate
  or not. This species difference suggests that humans’ concern for their own self-reputation,
  and their tendency to manage the impression they are making on others, may be unique
  to humans among primates.'
