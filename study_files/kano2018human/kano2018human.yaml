  (2018). Human ostensive signals do not enhance gaze following in chimpanzees, but
  do enhance object-oriented attention. Animal Cognition, 21(5), 715-728. doi:10.1007/s10071-018-1205-z.
abstract: The previous studies have shown that human infants and domestic dogs follow
  the gaze of a human agent only when the agent has addressed them ostensively—e.g.,
  by making eye contact, or calling their name. This evidence is interpreted as showing
  that they expect ostensive signals to precede referential information. The present
  study tested chimpanzees, one of the closest relatives to humans, in a series of
  eye-tracking experiments using an experimental design adapted from these previous
  studies. In the ostension conditions, a human actor made eye contact, called the
  participant’s name, and then looked at one of two objects. In the control conditions,
  a salient cue, which differed in each experiment (a colorful object, the actor’s
  nodding, or an eating action), attracted participants’ attention to the actor’s
  face, and then the actor looked at the object. Overall, chimpanzees followed the
  actor’s gaze to the cued object in both ostension and control conditions, and the
  ostensive signals did not enhance gaze following more than the control attention-getters.
  However, the ostensive signals enhanced subsequent attention to both target and
  distractor objects (but not to the actor’s face) more strongly than the control
  attention-getters—especially in the chimpanzees who had a close relationship with
  human caregivers. We interpret this as showing that chimpanzees have a simple form
  of communicative expectations on the basis of ostensive signals, but unlike human
  infants and dogs, they do not subsequently use the experimenter’s gaze to infer
  the intended referent. These results may reflect a limitation of non-domesticated
  species for interpreting humans’ ostensive signals in inter-species communication.
