abstract: Humans create social closeness with one another through a variety of shared
  social activities in which they align their emotions or mental states towards an
  external stimulus such as dancing to music together, playing board games together
  or even engaging in minimal shared experiences such as watching a movie together.
  Although these specific behaviours would seem to be uniquely human, it is unclear
  whether the underlying psychology is unique to the species, or if other species
  might possess some form of this psychological mechanism as well. Here we show that
  great apes who have visually attended to a video together with a human (study 1)
  and a conspecific (study 2) subsequently approach that individual faster (study
  1) or spend more time in their proximity (study 2) than when they had attended to
  something different. Our results suggest that one of the most basic mechanisms of
  human social bonding—feeling closer to those with whom we act or attend together—is
  present in both humans and great apes, and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than
  previously suspected.
