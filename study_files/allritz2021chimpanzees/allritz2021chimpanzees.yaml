abstract: Humans can tell when they find a task difficult. Subtle uncertainty behaviors
  like changes in motor speed and muscle tension precede and affect these experiences.
  Theories of animal metacognition likewise stress the importance of endogenous signals
  of uncertainty as cues that motivate metacognitive behaviors. However, while researchers
  have investigated second-order behaviors like information seeking and declining
  difficult trials in nonhuman animals, they have devoted little attention to the
  behaviors that express the cognitive conflict that gives rise to such behaviors
  in the first place. Here we explored whether three chimpanzees would, like humans,
  show hand wavering more when faced with more difficult choices in a touch screen
  transitive inference task. While accuracy was very high across all conditions, all
  chimpanzees wavered more frequently in trials that were objectively more difficult,
  demonstrating a signature behavior which accompanies experiences of difficulty in
  humans. This lends plausibility to the idea that feelings of uncertainty, like other
  emotions, can be studied in nonhuman animals. We propose to routinely assess uncertainty
  behaviors to inform models of procedural metacognition in nonhumaSn animals.
