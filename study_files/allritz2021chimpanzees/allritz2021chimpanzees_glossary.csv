"trial","presentation of the experiment to the ape participants - usually numerical "
"trial_subset","nth time in which this subset pair was presented within session"
"subset","unique two-item subset from a limited list of ten configurations. Each subset is presented three times per session for a total of 30 subset trials"
"early_item","early item presented within a subset trial (earlier item in the implied list- e.g. 2 is earlier than 4)"
"late_item","late (second) item presented within a subset trial (later item in the implied list- e.g. 4 is later than 2)"

"coord_early_y","coordinates of the early item presented on the y axis"
"coord_late_x","coordinates of the late item presented on the x axis"
"coord_late_y","coordinates of the late item presented on the y axis"
"magnitude","position of the smallest of the two subset items in the original five items list from 1 to 5"
"symbolic_distance","the difference between the list positions of the two subset items (e.g. 1 versus 4 has a distance of 3)"
"accuracy","Accuracy = 1 means that items were cleared in the correct order/ Accuracy = 0 means that items were not cleared in the correct order"
"latency","amount of time it took to touch the fist item presented on the screen (measured in milliseconds)"
"wavering","number of times that the individual wavered before the first item was touched"
"wavering_coder2","number of times that the individual wavered before the first item was touched according to a second coder. This measure is used for reliability"
