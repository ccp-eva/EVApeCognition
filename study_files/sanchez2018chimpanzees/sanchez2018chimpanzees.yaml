abstract: 'Social primates can influence others through the control of resources.
  For instance, dominant male chimpanzees might allow subordinates access to mate
  with females in exchange for social support. However, little is known about how
  chimpanzees strategically use a position of leverage to maximize their own benefits.
  We address this question by presenting dyads of captive chimpanzee (N = 6) with
  a task resulting in an unequal reward distribution. To gain the higher reward each
  individual should wait for their partner to act. In addition, one participant had
  leverage: access to an alternative secure reward. By varying the presence and value
  of the leverage we tested whether individuals used it strategically (e.g. by waiting
  longer for partners to act when they had leverage in the form of alternatives).
  Additionally, non-social controls served to show if chimpanzees understood the social
  dilemma. We measured the likelihood to choose the leverage and their latencies to
  act. The final decision made by the chimpanzees did not differ as a function of
  condition (test versus non-social control) or the value of the leverage, but they
  did wait longer to act when the leverage was smaller—particularly in test (versus
  non-social control) trials suggesting that they understood the conflict of interest
  involved. The chimpanzees thus recognized the existence of social leverage, but
  did not use it strategically to maximize their rewards.'
