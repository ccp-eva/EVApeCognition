abstract: Cooperation often comes with the temptation to defect and benefit at the
  cost of others. This tension between cooperation and defection is best captured
  in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma. Adult humans have specific strategies
  to maintain cooperation during Prisoner's Dilemma interactions. Yet, little is known
  about the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of human decision-making strategies
  in conflict scenarios. To shed light on this question, we compared the strategies
  used by chimpanzees and 5-year old children to overcome a social dilemma. In our
  task, waiting for the partner to act first produced the best results for the subject.
  Alternatively, they could mutually cooperate and divide the rewards. Our findings
  indicate that the two species differed substantially in their strategies to solve
  the task. Chimpanzees became more strategic across the study period by waiting longer
  to act in the social dilemma. Children developed a more efficient strategy of taking
  turns to reciprocate their rewards. Moreover, children used specific types of communication
  to coordinate with their partners. These results suggest that while both species
  behaved strategically to overcome a conflict situation, only children engaged in
  active cooperation to solve a social dilemma.
