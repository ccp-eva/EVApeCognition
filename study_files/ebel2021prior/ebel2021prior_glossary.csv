"success","success in the Experimental and the Stick&Grapes condition – ape rakes in the grapes / Grissini&Wood – ape does not rake-in"
"rake_attempt","ape touches reward with tool but does not retrieve it (eg because the breadstick breaks) – success / attempt / rake_hesitation / rake_toolate exclude each other (yet not in the control Grissini&Block – when they do not rake-in but try to – success and attempt = 1) "
"rake_hesitation","insert breadstick through mesh but not touching the reward before breadstick is too short to rake in"
