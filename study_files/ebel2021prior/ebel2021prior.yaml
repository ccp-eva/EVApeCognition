abstract: 'Humans use tools with specific functions to solve tasks more efficiently.
  However, functional specialization often comes at a cost: It can hinder the production
  of actions that are not usually performed with those tools, thus resulting in a
  fixation effect (functional fixedness). Little is known about whether our closest
  living relatives, the nonhuman great apes, are vulnerable to this detrimental effect
  of experience. We examined whether great apes from 4 species (N _ 35) would become
  fixated on the familiar action with an object. More precisely, some subjects experienced
  a novel food item (grissini), either whole or broken into pieces, whereas others
  did not. Then, subjects faced a task that required them to use the food item to
  rake in an out-of-reach food reward. Results indicated that all 4 species could
  use a food item as a tool. Apes were more likely to do so in the first trial when
  they had not experienced the tool as food before, even though they tasted the food
  before using it as a tool. Orangutans and bonobos used the food item more often
  as a tool than chimpanzees. A preference test ruled out that performance was dependent
  on individual or species food preferences. Our results suggest that apes might have
  represented one object in two different ways (i.e., as “food” and as “tool”) and
  then became fixated on one of these two representations. However, it is unclear
  whether the fixation occurred because of the item’s prior function or its identity..'
