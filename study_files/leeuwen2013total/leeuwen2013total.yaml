abstract: 'Chimpanzees have been shown to be adept learners, both individually and
  socially. Yet, sometimes their conservative nature seems to hamper the flexible
  adoption of superior alternatives, even to the extent that they persist in using
  entirely ineffective strategies. In this study, we investigated chimpanzees’ behavioural
  flexibility in two different conditions under which social animals have been predicted
  to abandon personal preferences and adopt alternative strategies: i) under influence
  of majority demonstrations (i.e. conformity), and ii) in the presence of superior
  reward contingencies (i.e. maximizing payoffs). Unlike previous nonhuman primate
  studies, this study disentangled the concept of conformity from the tendency to
  maintain one’s first-learned strategy. Studying captive (n=16) and semi-wild (n=12)
  chimpanzees in two complementary exchange paradigms, we found that chimpanzees did
  not abandon their behaviour in order to match the majority, but instead remained
  faithful to their first-learned strategy (Study 1a and 1b). However, the chimpanzees’
  fidelity to their first-learned strategy was overridden by an experimental upgrade
  of the profitability of the alternative strategy (Study 2). We interpret our observations
  in terms of chimpanzees’ relative weighing of behavioural options as a function
  of situation-specific trade-offs. More specifically, contrary to previous findings,
  chimpanzees in our study abandoned their familiar behaviour to maximize payoffs,
  but not to conform to a majority.'
