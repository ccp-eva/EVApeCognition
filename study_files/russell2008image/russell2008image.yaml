abstract: '''Image scoring'' occurs when person A monitors the giving behaviour of
  person B towards person C. We tested for ''image scoring'' in chimpanzees, bonobos,
  gorillas, and orangutans. Subjects passively observed two types of incident: (i)
  a ''nice'' person gave grapes to a human beggar, and (ii) a ''nasty'' person refused
  to give. The subject witnessed both incidents in succession (but was unable to obtain
  the grapes). Shortly after, the ape had an opportunity to approach one or both human
  actors (nice/nasty), both of whom were now sitting side-by-side holding grapes.
  However, neither human offered their grapes if approached. The subject''s expectation
  of which human was more likely to offer food was measured by comparing the proportion
  of time that subjects spent near each person. Chimpanzees (n=17) spent significantly
  more time at the ''nice'' window compared to ''nasty''. Also, preference for ''nasty''
  declined as trials progressed. Results for other apes were not significant.'
