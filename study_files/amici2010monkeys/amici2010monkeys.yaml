abstract: Differences in cognitive skills across taxa, and between monkeys and apes
  in particular, have been explained by different hypotheses, although these often
  are not supported by systematic interspecific comparisons. Here, we directly compared
  the cognitive performance of the four great apes and three monkey species (spider
  monkeys, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques), differing in their phylogenetic-relatedness
  and socioecology. We tested subjects on their ability to remember object locations
  (memory task), track object displacements (transposition task), and obtain out-of-reach
  rewards (support task). Our results showed no support for an overall clear-cut distinction
  in cognitive skills between monkeys and apes as species performance varied substantially
  across tasks. Although we found differences in performance at tracking object displacements
  between monkeys and apes, interspecific differences in the other two tasks were
  better explained in terms of differential socioecology, especially differential
  levels of fission–fusion dynamics. A cluster analysis using mean scores of each
  condition of the three tasks for each species suggested that the only dichotomy
  might be between members of the genus Pan and the rest of the tested species. These
  findings evidence the importance of using multiple tasks across multiple species
  in a comparative perspective to test different explanations for the enhancement
  of specific cognitive skills.
