abstract: Humans operate with a “theory of mind” with which they are able to understand
  that others’ actions are driven not by reality but by beliefs about reality, even
  when those beliefs are false. Although great apes share with humans many social-cognitive
  skills, they have repeatedly failed experimental tests of such false-belief understanding.
  We use an anticipatory looking test (originally developed for human infants) to
  show that three species of great apes reliably look in anticipation of an agent
  acting on a location where he falsely believes an object to be, even though the
  apes themselves know that the object is no longer there. Our results suggest that
  great apes also operate, at least on an implicit level, with an understanding of
  false beliefs.
