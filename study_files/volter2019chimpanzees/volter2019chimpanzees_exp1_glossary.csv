"model_name","name of data subset - retest_error_data_glmm_s01: the retest-data 9 months after the initial data period is analyzed The error data represent a scoring of the apes' choices (there were multiple choices per trial) and allow for analyzing factors that influenced their likelihoods to make mistakes. Trial_data_glmm02: the initial data period is analyzed The trial data allow for comparing the apes' performance to Monte-Carlo simulations. And the trial data are also sufficient for analyzing differences between conditions. error_data_glmm01: the initial data period is analyzed The error data represent a scoring of the apes' choices and allow for analyzing factors that influenced their likelihoods to make mistakes."
