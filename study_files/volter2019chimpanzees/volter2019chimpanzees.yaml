abstract: 'Working memory (WM) is a core executive function that allows individuals
  to hold, process and manipulate information. WM capacity has been repeatedly nominated
  as a key factor in human cognitive evolution; nevertheless, little is known about
  the WM abilities of our closest primate relatives. In this study, we examined signatures
  of WM ability in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Standard WM tasks for humans (Homo
  sapiens) often require participants to continuously update their WM. In Experiment
  1, we implemented this updating requirement in a foraging situation: zoo-housed
  chimpanzees (n = 13) searched for food in an array of containers. To avoid redundant
  searches, they needed to continuously update which containers they had already visited
  (similar to WM paradigms for human children) with 15 s retention intervals in between
  each choice. We examined chimpanzees'' WM capacity and to what extent they used
  spatial cues and object features to memorize their previous choices. In Experiment
  2, we investigated how susceptible their WM was to attentional interference, an
  important signature, setting WM in humans apart from long-term memory. We found
  large individual differences with some individuals remembering at least their last
  four choices. Chimpanzees used a combination of spatial cues and object features
  to remember which boxes they had chosen already. Moreover, their performance decreased
  specifically when competing memory information was introduced. Finally, we found
  that individual differences in task performance were highly reliable over time.
  Together, these findings show remarkable similarities between human and chimpanzee
  WM abilities despite evolutionary and life-history differences.'
