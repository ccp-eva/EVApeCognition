abstract: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) know what others can and cannot see in a competitive
  situation. Does this reflect a general understanding the perceptions of others?
  In a study by Hare et al. (2000) pairs of chimpanzees competed over two pieces of
  food. Subordinate individuals preferred to approach food that was behind a barrier
  that the dominant could not see, suggesting that chimpanzees can take the visual
  perspective of others. We extended this paradigm to the auditory modality to investigate
  whether chimpanzees are sensitive to whether a competitor can hear food rewards
  being hidden. Results suggested that the chimpanzees did not take what the competitor
  had heard into account, despite being able to locate the hiding place themselves
  by the noise.
