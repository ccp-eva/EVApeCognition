abstract: If chimpanzees are faced with two opaque boards on a table, in the context
  of searching for a single piece of food, they do not choose the board lying flat
  (because if food was under there it would not be lying flat) but, rather, they choose
  the slanted one- presumably inferring that some unperceived food underneath is causing
  the slant. Here we demonstrate that chimpanzees know that other chimpanzees in the
  same situation will make a similar inference. In a back-and-forth foraging game,
  when their competitor had chosen before them, chimpanzees tended to avoid the slanted
  board on the assumption that the competitor had already chosen it. Chimpanzees can
  determine the inferences that a conspecific is likely to make and then adjust their
  competitive strategies accordingly.
