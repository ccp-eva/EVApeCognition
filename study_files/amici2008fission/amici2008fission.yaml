abstract: The Machiavellian Intelligence or Social Brain Hypothesis explains the evolution
  of increased brain size as mainly driven by living in complex organized social systems
  1, 2, 3, 4 in which individuals represent 'moving targets' who can adopt multiple
  strategies to respond to one another [5]. Frequently splitting and merging in subgroups
  of variable composition (fission-fusion or FF dynamics) has been proposed as one
  aspect of social complexity (2, 6, 7, 8, 9; compare with [10]) that may be associated
  with an enhancement of cognitive skills like inhibition [11], which allows the suppression
  of prepotent but ineffective responses in a changing social environment [7]. We
  compared the performance of primates experiencing high levels of FF dynamics (chimpanzees,
  bonobos, orangutans, and spider monkeys) to that of species living in more cohesive
  groups (gorillas, capuchin monkeys, and long-tailed macaques) 12, 13 on five inhibition
  tasks. Testing species differing in diet, phylogenetic relatedness, and levels of
  FF dynamics allowed us to contrast ecological, phylogenetic, and socioecological
  explanations for interspecific differences. Spider monkeys performed at levels comparable
  to chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, and better than gorillas. A two-cluster
  analysis grouped all species with higher levels of FF dynamics together. These findings
  confirmed that enhanced inhibitory skills are positively associated with FF dynamics,
  more than to phylogenetic relations or feeding ecology.
