abstract: 'The authors administered a series of object displacement tasks to 24 great
  apes and 24 30-month-old children (Homo sapiens). Objects were placed under 1 or
  2 of 3 cups by visible or invisible displacements. The series included 6 tasks:
  delayed response, inhibition test, A not B, rotations, transpositions, and object
  permanence. Apes and children solved most tasks performing at comparable levels
  except in the transposition task, in which apes performed better than children.
  Ape species performed at comparable levels in all tasks except in single transpositions,
  in which chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) performed better
  than gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmeaus). All species found
  nonadjacent trials and rotations especially difficult. The number of elements that
  changed locations, the type of displacement, and having to inhibit predominant reaching
  responses were factors that negatively affected the subjectsâ€™ performance'
