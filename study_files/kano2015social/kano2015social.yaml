abstract: Humans’ two closest primate living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, differ
  behaviorally, cognitively, and emotionally in several ways despite their general
  similarities. While bonobos show more affiliative behaviors towards conspecifics,
  chimpanzees display more overt and severe aggression against conspecifics. From
  a cognitive standpoint, bonobos perform better in social coordination, gaze-following
  and food-related cooperation, while chimpanzees excel in tasks requiring extractive
  foraging skills. We hypothesized that attention and motivation play an important
  role in shaping the species differences in behavior, cognition, and emotion. Thus,
  we predicted that bonobos would pay more attention to the other individuals’ face
  and eyes, as those are related to social affiliation and social coordination, while
  chimpanzees would pay more attention to the action target objects, as they are related
  to foraging. Using eye-tracking we examined the bonobos’ and chimpanzees’ spontaneous
  scanning of pictures that included eyes, mouth, face, genitals, and action target
  objects of conspecifics. Although bonobos and chimpanzees viewed those elements
  overall similarly, bonobos viewed the face and eyes longer than chimpanzees, whereas
  chimpanzees viewed the other elements, the mouth, action target objects and genitals,
  longer than bonobos. In a discriminant analysis, the individual variation in viewing
  patterns robustly predicted the species of individuals, thus clearly demonstrating
  species-specific viewing patterns. We suggest that such attentional and motivational
  differences between bonobos and chimpanzees could have partly contributed to shaping
  the species-specific behaviors, cognition, and emotion of these species, even in
  a relatively short period of evolutionary time.
