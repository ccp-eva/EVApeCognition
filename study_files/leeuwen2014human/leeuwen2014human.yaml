abstract: Human societies are characterized by more cultural diversity than chimpanzee
  communities. However, it is currently unclear what mechanism might be driving this
  difference. Because reliance on social information is a pivotal characteristic of
  culture, we investigated individual and social information reliance in children
  and chimpanzees. We repeatedly presented subjects with a reward-retrieval task on
  which they had collected conflicting individual and social information of equal
  accuracy in counterbalanced order. While both species relied mostly on their individual
  information, children but not chimpanzees searched for the reward at the socially
  demonstrated location more than at a random location. Moreover, only children used
  social information adaptively when individual knowledge on the location of the reward
  had not yet been obtained. Social information usage determines information transmission
  and in conjunction with mechanisms that create cultural variants, such as innovation,
  it facilitates diversity. Our results may help explain why humans are more culturally
  diversified than chimpanzees.
