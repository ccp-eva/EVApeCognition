abstract: Mirror self-recognition (MSR) is considered an indicator of self-awareness.
  Standardized mirror tests reveal compelling evidence for MSR in a few non-human
  species, including all great apes. However, substantial inter-individual variation
  of MSR within species resulted in an ongoing methodological controversy, questioning
  the appropriateness of standard MSR tests for cross-species comparisons. Lack of
  motivation, in particular, is discussed as one possible cause for false negative
  results. Here, we compare the spontaneous behavioral response of 47 zoo-housed chimpanzees
  (Pan troglodytes) to (i) standard body-sized, stationary mirrors and (ii) small,
  portable hand mirrors. We predicted that the monopolizability and maneuverability
  of small mirrors increase the chances of identifying MSR across a larger proportion
  of individuals. Chimpanzees both revealed a substantially higher frequency of general
  mirror-related behaviors and engaged in significantly more and longer behaviors
  specifically indicating MSR when provided with small mirrors compared to a large
  mirror. Handheld mirrors provide a more sensitive measure for MSR within and likely
  between primate species than the traditional large mirrors, and thereby are a potentially
  valuable tool for studying self-awareness across species.
