abstract: Although chimpanzees understand what others may see, it is unclear whether
  they understand how others see things (Level 2 perspective-taking). We investigated
  whether chimpanzees can predict the behavior of a conspecific which is holding a
  mistaken perspective that differs from their own. The subject competed with a conspecific
  over two food sticks. While the subject could see that both were the same size,
  to the competitor one appeared bigger than the other. In a previously established
  game, the competitor chose one stick in private first and the subject chose thereafter,
  without knowing which of the sticks was gone. Chimpanzees and 6-year-old children
  chose the ‘riskier’ stick (that looked bigger to the competitor) significantly less
  in the game than in a nonsocial control. Children chose randomly in the control,
  thus showing Level 2 perspective-taking skills; in contrast, chimpanzees had a preference
  for the ‘riskier’ stick here, rendering it possible that they attributed their own
  preference to the competitor to predict her choice. We thus run a follow-up in which
  chimpanzees did not have a preference in the control. Now, they also chose randomly
  in the game. We conclude that chimpanzees solved the task by attributing their own
  preference to the other, while children truly understood the other’s mistaken perspective.
