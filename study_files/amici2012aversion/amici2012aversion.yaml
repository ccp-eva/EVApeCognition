abstract: Studies on how animals behave when two partners receive different amounts
  of food have produced variable results, with individuals responding negatively to
  specific food distributions in some cases (e.g., when food is distributed unequally
  between partners), but not in others. In this study, we used a simple experimental
  approach to (i) assess the strictness of dominance relationships based on the degree
  of social tolerance and (ii) compare the behavioural responses of seven primate
  species (chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes; bonobos, Pan paniscus; gorillas, Gorilla
  gorilla; orangutans, Pongo pygmaeus; brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella; spider
  monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi; long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis), when two
  partners received different amounts of food and no effort was required.We predicted
  that negative responses (i.e., refusal to participate in the task or avoidance of
  proximity to the food source) would be elicited by food distributions that violate
  the individual expectations based on tolerance levels and subject’s dominance rank
  relative to the partner. In the ‘tolerance’ task, we found that species with less
  strict dominance relationships were chimpanzees and bonobos, followed by orangutans,
  spider monkeys, gorillas, brown capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques. In the
  ‘food distribution’ task, capuchin monkeys and especially macaques showed their
  aversion by refusing to participate in most conditions, including the ones with
  equal food distribution. When dominants received more food than the partner, subjects
  of all species maintained a comparable amount of proximity to the food source, possibly
  reflecting the general acceptance of such a food distribution across species. When
  dominants received less than or as much as their partners, dominant capuchin monkeys
  maintained less proximity than other species, possibly because having different
  expectations of food distributions (i.e., more/all food to the dominant). Our study
  highlights the importance of the species’ degree of social tolerance and the relative
  dominance rank between partners in the study of violation of expectations of different
  food distributions
