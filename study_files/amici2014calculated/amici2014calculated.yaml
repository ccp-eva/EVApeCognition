abstract: Little evidence of calculated reciprocity has been found in non-human primates
  so far. In this study, we used a simple experimental set-up to test whether partners
  pulled a sliding table to altruistically provide food to each other in short-term
  interactions. We tested 46 dyads of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans,
  brown capu chin monkeys and spider monkeys to examine whether a subject’s tendency
  to provide food to a partner was directly affected by the partner’s previous behaviour,
  by the spe cies, by the condition (i.e., whether the partner could access the food
  provided by the subject) and by the social toler ance levels within each dyad. Chimpanzees
  and orangutans were the only species pulling significantly more when the partner
  could retrieve the food altruistically provided. However, no species reciprocated
  food exchanges, as subjects’ probability to pull was not affected by the pre vious
  number of the partner’s pulls, with the possible exception of one orangutan dyad.
  Although subjects clearly knew how the apparatus worked and easily obtained food
  for themselves, individuals did not usually take the opportunity to provide food
  to their partners, suggesting that calculated reciprocity is not a common behaviour
  and that food exchanges are usually not reciprocated in the short-term within dyads.
