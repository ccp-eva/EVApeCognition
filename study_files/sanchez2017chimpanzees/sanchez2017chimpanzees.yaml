abstract: Social animals need to coordinate with others to reap the benefits of groupliving
  even when individuals’ interests are misaligned. We compare how chimpanzees, bonobos
  and children coordinate their actions with a conspecific in a Snowdrift game, which
  provides a model for understanding how organisms coordinate and make decisions under
  conflict. In study 1, we presented pairs of chimpanzees, bonobos and children with
  an unequal reward distribution. In the critical condition, the preferred reward
  could only be obtained by waiting for the partner to act, with the risk that if
  no one acted, both would lose the rewards. Apes and children successfully coordinated
  to obtain the rewards. Children used a ‘both-partner-pull’ strategy and communicated
  during the task, while some apes relied on an ‘only-one-partner-pulls’ strategy
  to solve the task, although therewere also signs of strategic behaviour as they
  waited for their partner to pull when that strategy led to the preferred reward.
  In study 2, we presented pairs of chimpanzees and bonobos with the same set-up as
  in study 1 with the addition of a non-social option that provided them with a secure
  reward. In this situation, apes had to actively decide between the unequal distribution
  and the alternative. In this set-up, apes maximized their rewards by taking their
  partners’ potential actions into account. In conclusion, children and apes showed
  clear instances of strategic decision-making to maximize their own rewards while
  maintaining successful coordination.
