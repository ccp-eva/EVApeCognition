abstract: When presented with the broken cloth problem, both human children and nonhuman
  great apes prefer to pull a continuous cloth over a discontinuous cloth in order
  to obtain a desired object resting on top. This has been interpreted as evidence
  that they preferentially attend to the functionally relevant cues of the task (e.g.,
  presence or absence of a gap along the cloth). However, there is controversy regarding
  whether great apes’ behavior is underpinned by causal knowledge, involving abstract
  concepts (e.g., support, connection), or by perceptual knowledge, based on percepts
  (e.g., contact, continuity). We presented chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2-, 3-, and
  4-year-old children with two versions of the broken cloth problem. The Real condition,
  made with paper strips, could be solved based on either perceptual cues or causal
  knowledge. The Painted condition, which looked very similar, could be solved only
  by attending to perceptual cues. All groups mastered the Real condition, in line
  with previous results. Older children (3-and 4-year-olds) performed significantly
  better in this condition than all other groups, but the performance of apes and
  children did not differ sharply, with 2-year-olds and apes obtaining similar results.
  In contrast, only 4-year-olds solved the Painted condition.
