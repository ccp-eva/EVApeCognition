abstract: Planning defined as the predetermination of a sequence of actions towards
  some goal is crucial for complex problem solving. To shed light on the evolution
  of executive functions, we investigated the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins
  of planning. Therefore, we presented all four great apes species (N = 12) as well
  as 4- and 5-year-old human preschoolers (N = 24) with a vertical maze task. To gain
  a reward placed on the uppermost level of the maze, subjects had to move the reward
  to the bottom through open gaps situated at each level of the maze. In total, there
  were ten gaps located over three of the maze’s levels, and free passage through
  these gaps could be flexibly blocked using multiple traps. Due to the decision tree
  design of the maze, the subjects had to plan their actions depending on the trap
  configuration up to two steps ahead to successfully retrieve the reward. We found
  that (1) our measure of planning was negatively correlated with age in nonhuman
  apes, (2) younger apes as well as 5-year-old children planned their moves up to
  two steps ahead whereas 4-year-olds were limited to plan one step ahead, and (3)
  similar performance but different underlying limitations between apes and children.
  Namely, while all species of nonhuman apes were limited by a lack of motor control,
  human children exhibited a shortage in shifting their attention across a sequence
  of subgoals.
