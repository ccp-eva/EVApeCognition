abstract: S. T. Boysen and G. G. Berntson (1995) found that chimpanzees performed
  poorly on a reversed contingency task in which they had to point to the smaller
  of 2 food quantities to acquire the larger quantity. The authors compared the performance
  of 4 great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla
  gorilla) on the reversed contingency task while manipulating food quantity (0-4
  or 1-4) and food visibility (visible pairs or covered pairs). Results showed no
  systematic species differences but large individual differences. Some individuals
  of each species were able to solve the reversed contingency task. Both quantity
  and visibility of the food items had a significant effect on performance. Subjects
  performed better when the disparity between quantities was smaller and the quantities
  were not directly visible.
