abstract: In the reversed-reward contingency task, subjects are required to choose
  the less preferred of two options in order to obtain the more preferred one. Usually,
  this task is used to measure inhibitory skills, but it could also be used to measure
  how strong the subjects’ preferences are. We presented chimpanzees with support
  tasks where only one of two paper strips could physically bring food into reach.
  Subjects were rewarded for choosing the non-functional strip. In Experiment 1, subjects
  failed to pick the non-baited strip. In Experiment 2, subjects failed to pick the
  broken strip. Chimpanzees performed worse in these tasks than in other similar tasks
  where instead of paper strips, there were similar shapes painted on a platform.
  The fact that subjects found the reversed-reward contingency task based on causality
  more difficult to solve than a perceptually similar task with no causality involved
  (i.e., arbitrary) suggests that they did not treat real strips as an arbitrary task.
  Instead, they must have had some causal knowledge of the support problem that made
  them prefer functional over non-functional strips despite the contrary reward regime.
