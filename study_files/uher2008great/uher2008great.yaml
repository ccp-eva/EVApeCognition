abstract: We tested 6 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 3 orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus),
  4 bonobos (Pan paniscus), and 2 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in the reversed reward
  contingency task. Individuals were presented with pairs of quantities ranging between
  0 and 6 food items. Prior to testing, some experienced apes had solved this task
  using 2 quantities while others were totally naive. Experienced apes transferred
  their ability to multiple-novel pairs after 6 to 19 months had elapsed since their
  initial testing. Two out of 6 naive apes (1 chimpanzee, 1 bonobo) solved the taskâ€”a
  proportion comparable to that of a previous study using 2 pairs of quantities. Their
  acquisition speed was also comparable to the successful subjects from that study.
  The ratio between quantities explained a large portion of the variance but affected
  naive and experienced individuals differently. For smaller ratios, naive individuals
  were well below 50% correct and experienced ones were well above 50%, yet both groups
  tended to converge toward 50% for larger ratios. Thus, some apes require no procedural
  modifications to overcome their strong bias for selecting the larger of 2 quantities.
